Chapter 4 – Using the GPS
=========================

Introduction
____________
In this chapter we will see what a GPS does and how it works.  You will learn how to operate a GPS, and how to use it to create maps.  In this chapter we will explain how to operate the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx, a common GPS used for mapping.  There are many other models of GPS which do the same thing, so if you are working with a different one, don’t worry – the principles remain the same.

1.  What is GPS?
________________
A GPS is like a mobile phone, except that instead of receiving radio signals from telephone companies, it receives signals from satellites that are going around the Earth.  By receiving these signals from the satellites, a GPS is able to calculate your exact location on the planet.  It records this location in coordinates, which are two long numbers.  One number tells you how far East or West you are – this is called longitude.  The second number tells you how far North or South you are – this is called latitude.  Every place on Earth has unique geographic coordinates.

For example:  -8.639298 Latitude, 116.311607 Longitude is a location in Lombok, Indonesia.

2.  Turn on the GPS
___________________
Before you turn on your GPS, go outside where you have a clear view of the sky.  Because the GPS determines your location by receiving signals from satellites, it won’t work indoors.
On the right side of your GPS, press and hold the Power button.  The GPS will start, and it will show you the Satellites page.  You should see something like the image below.  Your GPS is looking for satellite signals.  When it has connected to three or more satellites, it will have your location.

   Once your location is determined, the Satellite screen will disappear and you will see the main menu.

3.  Navigate the GPS
____________________
- The GPS has different screens and menus that allow you to do different things.  To switch between screens, press the button marked “X”, just above the power button on the right side of the device.  This button also serves to go back.  If you press something by mistake and would like to cancel or go back, press the “X” button.
- By pressing the X button, you should be able to flip through different screens that will look something like this:

   :align: center
   :width: 600px

- If you return to the Satellites page, you can see that you are connected to three or more satellites.  In the upper left corner are your coordinates, your latitude and longitude.
- Flip to the Map page, and you can see a map of where you are.  If you have added OSM maps to your GPS, you may see roads and places.  Otherwise, the map may look quite blank.  Zoom in and out by pressing the up and down arrow buttons on the left side of the GPS.

4.  Tracks and Waypoints
________________________
Your GPS records two kinds of information that are useful for creating maps or saving the coordinates of a place.  First, it allows you to save your location in the memory of the GPS.  When you save a location, the coordinates will be saved with a name.  For example, your first saved point will be named 001, the second 002, and so on.  When you save a point, you can write down the number on a piece of paper, along with a note about what it is, any any attribute or indicators you would like to know.  Saved locations on your GPS are called waypoints.Second, your GPS can save what are called tracks.  While a waypoint only saves a single location, a track will save a series of locations wherever you move.  For example, the track will record your location every one second, or every one meter, and the result will be a series of dots that show the path of where you have been.  Tracks are useful for mapping objects that are represented by lines or shapes, such as the course of a road, or the shape of a field.

   A GPS can record a single point as well as a path of where you travel. Here the points are numbered in the order they are recorded. The path, or “track”, is shown in red.

5.  Save Your Location
______________________
- To save your current location as a waypoint, click the “X” button until your reach the Main Menu.  Using the joystick, move it so that “Mark” is highlighted on the screen.  Push the joystick button down to open the “Save Waypoint” page.

.. image:: ../_static/save_location2.jpeg
   :align: center
   :width: 296px

- You can see on this page some information about the waypoint that you are saving.  First is the name.  If this is your first waypoint, it probably reads “001”.  This is the number you should record on paper along with the information you want to collect with this object.  Next you will see the time and date when the point is recorded.  Below that are the coordinates, followed by the altitude.
- Use the joystick to move to the “OK” button at the bottom of the screen.  Press the joystick button down to save this point.  Be sure to write down the number of the point, along with what the place is and any other information you want to record about the place in your notebook.
- Press the “X” button to go to the map page.  You should now see your point on the map.

6.  Turn on the Track Log
_________________________
- Now that we have learned how to save points, let’s learn how to turn the track log on and off.  When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path.  It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished.  You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.  If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.
- To turn on the track log, click the “X” button until your reach the page that says Track Log.

- If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the joystick down.  The bar at the top should read “0%”
- To turn on the log, move the joystick to highlight “On”, and press the joystick down.  The track log is now recording your path.
- Press the “X” button to go to the map page.  As you move you will see your track shown as a series of dots.

7.  Copy Waypoints and Tracks to the Computer
_____________________________________________
7.1  Attach GPS to the Computer
_______________________________
- When you are finished mapping with the GPS you will want to copy the points and tracks to your computer so that you can open them in JOSM.  First, turn off the track log on your GPS, by going to the track page and selecting “Off”.
- Attach the GPS to your computer with the cable.  One end should plug into your computer’s USB port, and the other goes into the back of the GPS, beneath the rubber flap at the top.  The GPS should be turned on to copy the points and tracks.

7.2  Install GPS Drivers

Summary
_______
Congratulations!  You should now have an understanding of how to use the GPS.  If you haven’t already, practice saving points of some important locations.  In this chapter you learned how to open your points and tracks in JOSM.  In Chapter 6, we will use this information to add new places to OpenStreetMap.In the next chapter, we will learn about Walking Papers, which is another way of collecting information for OpenStreetMap.  With Walking Papers, all you need is paper and a pen, and you can collect the coordinates of places just like with a GPS.
