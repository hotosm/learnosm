Converting to Shapefile
=======================



5)  Converting to Shapefile
There are various tools that convert OSM data into shapefiles, each with its own pros and cons.  They all work via the command-line, so are best suited for those with a technical background.  Some of the tools are:
osm2shp
C++ application for converting OSM to shapefile.
http://trac.openstreetmap.org/browser/applications/utils/export/osm2shp
osmlib
Ruby library for converting to OSM.  Hasnâ€™t been maintained in a long time but still is functional.  Not good with very large datasets.  Easy to configure.

ogr2ogr
This library has recently added support for OSM, and can convert to all common geographic data formats.
