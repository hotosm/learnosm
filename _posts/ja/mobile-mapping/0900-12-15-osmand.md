OsmAnd
======================================================

** A newer version of this section, OSMAND 2, is available within the English section of this site.**


OsmAnd (OSM Automated Navigation Directions) is an open source mapping
and navigation application which uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Vector
and raster map data can be stored in the device storage. It also
includes a routing and navigation feature, with visual and voice
guidance. 

Installation and Configuration 
--------------------------------

### Google Play Store 
Install the app from the Google Play Store by searching for “OsmAnd”, or
install the app through an Internet browser at
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand) and
choose from either the Free or Paid edition.  

### Configuration

To add the ability to add or edit data from OpenStreetMap, you must
configure OsmAnd with your OpenStreetMap credentials: From the main
screen, go to Settings \> Plugins \> activate OSM Editing Plugin. After
that go to Settings \>  OSM editing. Add your username and password.

If these credentials are not set, the user can only report bugs.
 Although the user interface includes this option to “report bugs”, it’s
only created as a note on the OpenStreetMap website.

After the installation, OsmAnd is ready to work offline, however, you
have to download one (or more) offline maps for your location.

![Downloading offline maps][]

Go to **Settings \> Data management** and press the download icon (1) which
will bring you to the download screen. You can choose from Regular maps
(2) or Roads-only maps (for low-powered devices, with limited storage
spaces, or for simple navigation). In the filter field, type in your
country or area of interest and it will display a list of matching data
available for download.  Click on the check box of the item that matches
your requirement (4) and press the “Download” button at the bottom of
the screen.

### Logging Intervals

The Logging interval option under **Menu \> Settings \> Logging services &
Sleep mode** is where the logging precision of your GPS track is set. The
available option range from 1 second up to 5 minutes.  Your selected
profile (Vehicle, Bike, Pedestrian) will have different default values
(2-, 5-, 10-seconds respectively).  Logging precision affects battery
life and data accuracy.

User Interface
--------------------------

![Main Screen][]

#### Main screen

OsmAnd’s Main screen is divided into four buttons. The **Map** button brings
up the mapping and navigation screen. The **Search** button will allow you
to search for features, including POIs, Addresses, Coordinates, recent
history and transport-related POIs. The **Favorites** will have your list of
POIs tagged as favorite.  The **Settings** button will have the options for
configuring your OsmAnd installation further.

#### Map Screen

![Map Screen][]

The **Status ba**r (1) shows various icons: Compass, Logging services,
View Definition, Screen Configuration, Location information. You may add
or remove icons from the Status bar by calling the **Configure Screen**
configuration under **Menu** (5).

The panel on the right (2) displays the following widgets: GPS
information (satellite icon), GPX recording status, Distance
measurement, and Audio/Video notes.

The main canvass displays a map of the area of interest.  A long press
on the canvas will open a dialog box (3) that shows the geographic
coordinates. Pressing this dialog box will open a Contextual menu,
discussed in the next section.

You can **zoom in or out** (6) of the canvass to display more or less of
area of interest.


#### Contextual Menus

![Contextual Menus][]

The Contextual Menu displays additional options related to a specific
geographic coordinate activate from a long press (see previous section.)

**Directions To, Set as Destination, Directions From,** and **Add a GPX
waypoint** are options related to navigating routes.

**Search near here** provides for localized search, limited to POIs
available in the installed database.

Select **Add to favorites** to mark frequently used POIs.

**Take an audio note, Take a video note**, and **Take a photo** are 
multimedia capture options.

To add a new POI directly to OpenStreetMap in the selected coordinates,
select **Create POI**. Use **Open OSM Bug** for notations like bug reports, or
to leave a comment for other mappers working in the same area.


Online Data Collection (with mobile data) 
----------------------------------------------

#### Create a POI

Long press on a location to display the coordinates for a given point,
then click on the popup to display the context menu. Select **Create POI**
to add a new feature, along with the tags.

Add the POI’s field information: name, and a commit comment explaining
the feature you’re adding. In Advanced mode, more tags can be added.
When done, select **Commit**.

![Create a POI][]


#### Modify or Delete POIs

First, make sure to enable the POIs by going to **Layers \> POI** and select
**Any**. Now you should see your POIs with orange circles over them. By
long pressing on a POI you will see two options from the context menu:
**Modify POI** for editing, and **Delete POI**. A window will appear where
you can update the POI fields, as necessary. It’s a good idea to add a
comment or commit notes when modifying POIs.

![Select an existing POI][] 

![Modify POI][]

If you choose to delete a POI, a confirmation window will appear asking
you to enter a comment or commit notes.

#### Notes: Commenting, Adding and Closing

If an Internet connection is available, it is also possible to close
Bugs (Notes), or add comments to it.

Offline Data Collection (without mobile data connection)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is if you plan to collect data off-the-grid, without an active
mobile data connection. Head back to the main screen, go to **Settings \>
OSM Editing**, and enable the **Offline editing** option by ticking the
checkbox beside it.

Changes you make offline will remain in your device until you connect to
the Internet.

You can manage the data you have collected from **Settings \> OSM
Editing** and select the **Locally saved OSM POIs/Bugs** option.  The data
listed in this screen is color coded. Green is for new or modified POIs,
and red is for POIs you’ve marked for deletion.

![Lists of locally saved bugs][]

From here, you may opt to upload the data to OSM or save these changes
locally, in your device.


​Collecting GPX tracks
---------------------

Before you start collecting GPX tracks, verify if **Logging services &
Sleep mode** is enabled under **Settings \> Plugins**.

![Enable logging services and sleep mode][]

To enable the GPX recording widget on the mapping interface, go to
configure screen (1) and tick the check box for the GPX recording (2)
option under the Right panel section. This widget is useful for starting
and stopping track logging (3) (i.e. while taking a photo or notes of
where you are)

![GPX recording][]

To capture Audio or Video notes conveniently from the main screen,
enable Audio/video notes option from the under **Settings \> Plugins** (1)
then go to the configuration screen and check on the Audio/video notes
(2) tick box.

If you take photos often, instead of video or audio notes, change the
default action for the Audio/Video widget. Go to **Settings \> Audio/video
settings (1) \> Default widget action (2)** and select **Take a photo** (3).

![Settings for using photos][]

Collecting Photos, Videos or Audio notes.
-------------------------------------------


To capture a photo (or video, or audio note) of a particular feature,
press and hold over the location on the map, then press the pop-up
dialog that comes up and select an action: take an audio note, take a
video note, take a photo, or select other appropriate options from the
context menu.

![Taking audio, photo or notes][]

Displaying GPX tracks 
--------------------------------------------

To display the GPX tracks, go to **Menu \> Define View** and enable the
**GPX track...** option. This will display a list of options including the
current track you may be recording, or other GPX tracks you’ve
previously recorded or stored in your device’s OsmAnd folder.

Showing GPX tracks on the canvass is useful for keeping track of your
progress while on the field , and to check whether there’s anything
you’ve missed along the way.

![Display GPS tracks][]

Exporting GPX tracks to OpenStreetMap editor
--------------------------------------------

When you’re done collecting field data, you can import your GPX tracks
for use in JOSM (or another OpenStreetMap editor, including iD).

Connect your Android device to a computer and copy the GPX tracks and
multimedia files you’ve captured.  In your device storage, look for the
GPX track under folder /osmand/tracks, and the multimedia files
/osmand/avnotes.

For instructions on how to use the GPX track, along with the multimedia
files in JOSM see the section Open in
JOSM.

For iD editor users, see the section Configuring the Background Layer.

For other OpenStreetMap editors, please refer to your software’s
documentation.

Summary
-------------------

Good work! You could now make use of a smartphone for collecting field
data that you can add in OpenStreetMap, as an alternative to dedicated
GPS receivers. The wide availability of smartphones with GPS (and/or
GLONASS) open new opportunities for collecting and updating
OpenStreetMap data by casual mappers.

Take some time to practice and familiarize yourself with the app before
working with live data.

This section introduced the concept of collecting GPX tracks, modifying
or deleting POIs, including adding, commenting or closing Notes/Bugs
using OsmAnd. Moving GPX tracks and related data for use in another
editor was also discussed.
