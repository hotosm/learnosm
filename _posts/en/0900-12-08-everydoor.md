EveryDoor
===================

EveryDoor is an open-source OSM editor developed by Ilya Zverev. It is a user-friendly mobile application that focuses on mapping and updating POIs. It is available for both Android and iOS devices.

Setting up
---------------
- Download Every Door using Play Store for Android devices or App Store for iOS devices.

- First, you need to log in to your OSM account. Go to the application’s  configuration settings by clicking the upper left button. 

![Setting up][]

- Confirm your location by dragging through the map.

- Click the red panel to download the OSM data within your selected area.

Amenity Mode
---------------
This editing mode lets you map and verify amenity points. Here is the application’s interface for the Amenity Mode.

![Amenity Mode][]

- A list of amenities will appear on the lower panel with their corresponding locations on the map.

- Click each item on the list to review its existing data. Use the information that you get while field mapping to update as many fields as possible.

![Amenity Mode Fields][]

- Amenities highlighted in **yellow** are either outdated by at least 5 years, or contain errors that need to be resolved. Prioritize verifying these amenities.

- For adding a new amenity, click the add button, aim the pin to its location by dragging the screen, then press check. Search its amenity type, input all available information, and click save.

Micromapping Mode
---------------
Micromapping mode is used for mapping POIs other than amenity points. Here is the interface for the micromapping mode:

![Micromapping Mode][]

The map shows all POIs around your location pin, while the lower panel shows the types of these points.

For updating existing POIs, press the points on the map and edit/add information.
For adding new POIs, follow the same 4-step ADD - AIM - TAG - INPUT AND SAVE process.

Buildings and Entrance Mode
---------------
This mode offers editing of building attributes and adding building entrance points. Here is the interface for the buildings and entrance mode:

![Buildings and Entrance Mode][]

- On the map, building footprints are represented by squares, while the entrance points are represented by circles.

- In editing building attributes, select a box on the map then input all available information.

- In adding a building entrance point, follow the same 4-step **ADD - AIM - TAG - INPUT AND SAVE process**. *Keep in mind that entrance points must only be placed on the side of buildings.*

Saving
---------------
- Once you have made your changes, click the button on the lower right corner of the screen. Your edits will then be uploaded to OSM.

![Saving][]

- Remember to upload as often as you can. Saving too many edits and uploading them all at once can cause errors if multiple people are mapping in the same area.
