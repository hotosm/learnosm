Intermediate's Guide
====================

Welcome to the Intermediate Guide of using OSM. This guide dives more into the details
of editing and validating. We look at shortcuts and ways to contribute to the OSM
community, such as through wiki sites or the tasking manager. Understanding these
elements are useful for developing better and more effective additions to OSM.
Hopefully, by the end of this guide you will be able to develop the skills and 
tools needed to correct and strengthen the quality of data in OSM.
