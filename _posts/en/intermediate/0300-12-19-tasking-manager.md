Tasking Manager
===============

In the previous chapter, we looked at various ways to ensure quality
when contributing to OpenStreetMap.  In this section, we will take a
look at the HOT Tasking Manager, a tool that mappers can use to sort an
area into a grid, and work together to map an area in an organized way.

One consistent challenge is coordinating field and/or remote workers to
map an area together.  To help address this, HOT has developed an
OpenStreetMap Tasking Tool to make it easier for administrators to
define the areas of mapping interest and to delegate workers.  The idea
behind this tool is that if there is an area, let’s say a city, that we
want to map, and we have some people mapping on the ground, and some
people mapping remotely using satellite imagery, this tool will allow us
to create a grid of the entire area.  Collaborators can select blocks in
the grid that they plan to map, and when they finish, they can mark that
area as complete.  In this way a team of many people can coordinate to
map the entire grid

To see how the tasking manager works, let’s take a closer look.

-   Open your Internet browser and go to
    [tasks.hotosm.org](http://tasks.hotosm.org). You will see a page
    like this:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/intermediate/en_int_ch5_image01.png)

-   Click “Log in using your OpenStreetMap account \>\>”
-   Here you are agreeing to allow this application some access to your
    OpenStreetMap account.  Click “Save Changes.”

-   Now you will see the current list of projects.  These are different
    places that people are coordinating to map.

-   Click on one of the projects to see more information about it.

-   This page shows you everything you need to know about the project.
     On the left side of the page is the description of mapping
    project and how to make it organized.  You can click on the
    different tabs to get more information.  On the right side is a grid
    showing the area to be mapped.  Red grid squares have been
    completed, green squares have been completed and checked by another
    person, and the remaining squares still need to be mapped or are
    being worked on.  By clicking on the “Workflow” tab, you can get
    information about how collaborators are meant to help map.  By
    clicking on “Task,” you can take a grid square to work on yourself.

-   Here, you see a view of square that you have offered to map.  You
    can automatically open the area up for editing with JOSM, Potlatch
    2, or create a Walking Paper.
-   If you're going to edit on JOSM, you need to enable JOSM plugin
    before you will be able to launch the application from the Tasking
    Manager.  To do this, open JOSM and go the Preferences menu.  Click
    on the “Remote Settings” tab and check the box next to “Enable
    remote control.”  Restart JOSM.

-   Go back to the Tasking Manager and choose JOSM.  If you have JOSM
    open and you correctly enabled the remote control, the grid area of
    the map you selected will automatically be loaded into JOSM.
-   You may now edit the area using the instructions provided in the
    project information.  When you are finished, you can return to the
    tasking manager website and add comments about your changes.  Click
    “Mark task as done” to let other collaborators know that you have
    finished this grid square.  If you were unable to complete the task,
    click “Unlock it” to make it available again for other mappers.

-   If you are wondering what happens when you finish an area, the grid
    square will turn red on the map to indicate that is done.  Someone
    else will then look at your work to make sure it is good, and if
    they agree that you’ve completed the square well, the grid square
    will turn green, meaning it is complete!

Summary
-------

The Tasking Manager can be quite useful for mapping an area rapidly and
ensuring completeness and data quality.  It can be quite helpful in
managing many various mappers both in one location and around the world.
