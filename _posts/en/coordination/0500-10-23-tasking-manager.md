# Tasking Manager


In this section, we look at the HOT Tasking Manager, a tool that mappers can use to sort an area into a grid, and work together to map an area in an organized way. The OSM Tasking Manager allows mappers throughout the world to assist in mapping a defined region with a minimum risk of overlapping work areas ( *software editing tools use the term "conflict" when two mappers attempt to save changes to the same object - their work has overlapped* ). 

## Overview of the process

1. An administrator selects an area requiring updating in OpenStreetMap. The administrator ensures there is suitable satellite imagery available for remote mappers to trace, and creates a task or project covering the area. The level of detail required and the urgency are specified within the task together with any other information the remote mapper will require. When satisfied, the administrator publishes the task within the Tasking Manager, although they may also make changes later if required.
2. A remote mapper (also sometimes referred to as armchair mappers) selects a task square, completes the mapping, and marks the square as complete.
3. A second remote mapper checks that the square is completed to a satisfactory level and marks the square as 'validated'


To see how the tasking manager works, let’s take a closer look.

-   Open your Internet browser and go to
    [tasks.hotosm.org](http://tasks.hotosm.org). You will see a page like this:

![Tasking Manager Login][]

-   Click “login to OpenStreetMap”
-   Here you are agreeing to allow this application some access to your OpenStreetMap account.  Click “Save Changes.”

The Task Manager initially displays in english - to change to another language click on "en" in the red header banner.

-   The current list of projects may be sorted according to;  

 1. High Priority First
 2. Creation date, or
 3. Last update.

You can further refine your list by clicking in the **Your Projects** box, to see just the projects in which you have marked squares as complete, and/or you may use a free text search to locate tasks that contain particular text strings, such as **Ebola** (search is not case sensitive).

-   Click on a blue project title to see more information about that project.

![Job description][]

This page shows you everything you need to know about the project. On the left side of the page is a description of the mapping project and what is required. On the right side is a grid showing the area to be mapped;  
* Pink areas of the map indicate higher priority areas,  
* Yellow grid squares have been completed,  
* A yellow border indicates the square is being worked on now,  
* Green squares have been completed and “validated”, and the remaining squares still need to be mapped or are being worked on.  
By clicking on the “Instructions” tab, you can get information about how collaborators are meant to help map. There will be a section indicating the *Changeset comment* you should copy & paste into your editing programme when uploading your changes, together with the *source* information you may (depending on your editing software) need to copy & paste to the source field on making changes. Clicking on the “Activity” tab will show the activity within the task, and clicking the “Stats” tab will show a graph of progress & other information.  

You may chose your square to work on by selecting it from the map, or by clicking on the *Take a Task at random* option.

![Picking a task][]

Having selected your square you will be able to see if there is any history for this square, such as a mapper starting to map, but realising they do not have time to complete the square.  
* If you accidentally select a square, you can release it again by clicking on the blue 'x' - shown level with the **Task#26** text in this screenshot.  
* If you start working on a square, but cannot complete it for some reason, it is best practice to leave a comment against the square, such as *'Almost complete, small village top left in the square to be traced - I've run out of time, hence releasing this square'*  
* It is very difficult to be completely certain that you have completed a square - however it is acceptable to mark the square as complete if you are fairly sure - the contents will be checked by another mapper when validating, and any small additions can be made then. For the process to work, mappers need to mark squares as complete rather than leaving them for several other 'not sure' mappers to spend time also checking them.   
* When leaving a comment against a square, you can have the comment sent as a message to a named mapper - @ followed by the username, such as **@Tallguy** in the text will send a message to Tallguy containing the comments from this box. This is particularly useful when validating, to send a useful encouraging hint to a new mapper, although there are many occassions when the language barrier prevents this.

![Assigned task square][]

You may now edit the area using the instructions provided in the project information.  When you are finished, you can return to the tasking manager website and add comments about your changes.  Click “Mark task as done” to let other collaborators know that you have finished this grid square.  If you were unable to complete the task, click “Unlock it” to make it available again for other mappers, adding a comment explaining what is still outstanding.

Summary
------------------

The Tasking Manager can be quite useful for mapping an area rapidly and
ensuring completeness and data quality.  It can be quite helpful in
managing many various mappers both in one location and around the world.
