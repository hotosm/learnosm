#Nepal Disaster  

![HotGuideLogo](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/sites/default/themes/hot/logo.png)

Thank you for volunteering to help the Aid Organisations by providing mapping data for them. 

Like you, we are keen to help as quickly as possible, and there is a real sense of urgency in what we do. But, the reason the Aid Organisations depend on us to provide the mapping data is because we take care to make sure that what we produce is useful and meets their needs. We need you to take care too. Although it will delay you starting to update the map we need you to understand what is required of you. Do not rush in and make a mess of it, because it takes us longer to clear up bad work than it does to create it, and it may cause a care worker to have doubts about the dependability of what we produce. 

We are constantly updating our software & training guides, but it does take time. The software in the Tasking Manager will be updated soon so that only qualified people can 'validate', but at the moment we need you to understand that validating should be left for the qualified few - please keep helping and you may become one of our validators in the future. **If you select a square and the screen mentions 'Review the work' then please release the square, because that is something that needs a 'validator'.**

We don't need you to read the whole of this site before you start, but we do need you to understand the basics:  

1.  You need to read the Task Manager Instructions for any project you are trying to help for. They can be different, so make sure you read & understand them. There is a full description of how to use the [Tasking Manager here within LearnOSM](/en/coordination/tasking-manager/), and it includes how to get live help from an experienced mapper.  

2.  Make sure you have zoomed in enough so that you can actually see what you should be tracing - [it and many other things are explained here.](/en/coordination/remote/#initial-view--josm)

3.  Buildings have to be traced, and the shape of the tracing should match the shape of the building. [This section of LearnOSM](/en/coordination/remote-tracing/) explains this, and how to create roads and a road network.

Thank you for reading this, and we hope you'll take the short time needed to make sure you do the important things right. We need all the help we can get, and hope that you can help us with this.

Please remember, that although the earthquake is very recent, the problems will continue for a very long time. People no longer have housing, and are living in shelters at the mercy of more bad weather. Hygiene will become difficult and there is the possibility of disease and other problems related to food and water. Although you may not see the problems mentioned in the news, they will still exist, and the aid workers will need maps that reflect the current situation. Please help us now, but please remember to come back and help us again in the future.
