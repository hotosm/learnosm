Advance Guide
================

Welcome to the Advance Guide of using OSM. This guide is intended for users 
who are familiar with OSM and the topics covered in the Beginner and 
Intermediate guides. The modules presented here presume greater technical 
know-how than the previous guides, and may not be suitable for those with 
limited computer experience. Some chapters are of moderate difficulty, 
and some are quite complex.

**Operating Systems**

Thus far all of our work has been in Windows, because it is such a
common operating system. However, many databases and websites are run
on Linux. Therefore some sections of this guide will be
focused on Linux and/or Mac, rather than Windows. Where possible we
will keep most of the tutorials focused on Windows machines, but in some
places we will also provide instructions for other operating systems.

PostGIS, WMS Services, TileMill and Github are all Windows friendly;
however, the Private Data Storage requires another operating system
beside Windows. For Windows users looking to challenge themselves they
can download a [virtual machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and
install the Ubuntu Operating System (Ubuntu 12.04) on it. Hopefully, by
the end of these chapters you will be able to confidently store,
transfer and create custom OSM maps.
