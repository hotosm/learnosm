Cartography With TileMill
==============================

Maps for display on websites commonly use interfaces like the OSM
“Slippy Map,” a map that users can drag and zoom in and out of. One of
the great advantages of using OpenStreetMap is the ability to customize
the style of these maps and display them on websites. In the next two
chapters we will go through several tools that will allow us to do this
with ease. First, we'll learn how to use TileMill to create beautiful
maps. Then in the next chapter, we'll learn how we can embed these maps
on websites using MapBox. This chapter dives deep into complex map
styling, and will help you to create elegant, beautiful maps. If you
want to design your own maps but are happy to just use the basic
OpenStreetMap data, you may wish to skip to the next chapter, and learn
first how to make a simple map design with MapBox.

In this chapter, our map designs will be based on a type of service
known as a TMS, or Tile Map Service. This is quite similar to a WMS
(Web Map Service), except that map images are all created in 256x256
pixel tiles, which are delivered to a user and then displayed together.
TMS has many advantages over WMS, and has grown in popularity immensely
since the advent of the slippy map. When you are looking at a slippy
map you are in fact looking at a bunch of separate image files that have
been rendered and stitched together.

The OSM Slippy Map is made of many individual image tiles.

TileMill is a rugged application for designing detailed, beautiful maps.
It is not meant for editing data or conducting analysis, but rather for
cartography. With TileMill you use:

* data (this could be your OpenStreetMap database, or shapefiles)
* icons (you can use existing icons or design your own)

TileMill provides a platform in which you can style your data in an
elegant way and apply your own icons. You can then export your map as
an image or in the MBTiles format, which can be hosted on MapBox and
placed on your website as an interactive map.

In this chapter we will go through:

1. Installing TileMill
2. Exploring TileMill (Map, Legend, Teaser, CartoCSS)
3. Adding Data (Shapefiles and OSM Database)
(Editing OSM Data with JOSM Plugin)
4. Styling with CartoCSS (Line Styling, Polygon Styling, Point
Styling, Zoom Levels, Color Variables, Comments)
5. Creating a Legend
6. Exporting a Map (PNG Image & MBTiles)

Installing TileMill
----------------------------

Here we’ll demonstrate how to install TileMill on Windows. You can
download installers for other operating systems at
[http://mapbox.com/tilemill/](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/).

1. Go to [http://mapbox.com/tilemill/](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) and
   download the TileMill setup file for Windows. 
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image04.png)

2. Run the installer to set up TileMill on your computer. The default
   options in the installation wizard should be fine.

3. Once TileMill is installed go to your Start Menu and click 
   “Start  TileMill.” 
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image29.png)

4. This will load the projects tab of the application. TileMill comes
   with several example projects that you can use to get started.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image02.png)

Exploring TileMill
---------------------------

Let’s take a look at one of the sample projects to get an idea of
TileMill’s features and what we can do. Open the sample project named
“Geography Class.” It may take 10-20 seconds for the map to load.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image13.png)

Notice the key elements of TileMill:

**Map**

The map window shows what your map looks like according to your current
styling. It will update as you change the data and styling of your
project. You must click the "save" button for any changes to take
effect. Sometime it takes a while to render all of the OSM data and so
you may see a blank grid screen for a few minutes.

**Legend**

You can create a legend to sit on your map using HTML. To see and edit
the HTML used to create the legend, click on the button in the
bottom-left that looks like a hand. Use previous projects, like
Openstreetmap DC, to get ideas for how you would like your legend to
look.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image28.png)

**Teaser**

The teaser, which defines the pop-ups or information that show when you
scroll or click on featured parts of the map, is created with HTML just
like the legend. On this map the teaser changes flags depending on the
country that the user hovers the mouse over.

**CartoCSS**

This is the most important part of TileMill in terms of styling the map.
Any TileMill project will have a number files like this which describe
the way the map data should be styled. The language used is called
CartoCSS, because it is similar to CSS but specifically designed for
styling maps. We will look more closely at CartoCSS later in this
chapter, but for now look at the three files that are used to the style
the “Geography Class” map. The first file, style.mss contains code that
does basic styling for the map, defining the color of bodies of water
and the outline of the continents. labels.mss describes how the country
names should be displayed. It includes information on the font, the
size of the text, and more. It also indicates that when the user is
zoomed out quite far, the map should display country abbreviations
instead of their full names. Lastly, rainbow.mss describes how each
country should be colored. In this file, nearly every country is
manually given a color for the map.

Feel free to play around with this sample project to see how different
features work. Anytime you change the CartoCSS files you can reload the
map by clicking “Save.” When the map reloads it will incorporate your
changes into the styling. TileMill is quite intelligent, and if you
make a mistake in the CSS it will alert you that there is an error when
you try to save it.

If you would like to change the project settings, click on the wrench in
the upper right corner. The Geography Class project will only let you
zoom in about halfway on the map. If you enter the settings you can
adjust the zoom level to go deeper. Try moving it from 0 to 8 to 0 to
12. This will allow you to zoom in further on the map.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image10.png)

Adding Data
--------------------

The project already has a number of layers, that you can view by
clicking the “Layers” button in the bottom left corner.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image21.png)

This list shows all of the layers in your project. The icon to left of
each layer name indicates whether it is a point, line, or polygon layer.
To the right of each layer name are buttons which let you view the
layer data or edit settings.

### Add a New Shapefile Layer

1. Let’s add a new shapefile layer to the map. Click “Add Layer.”
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image30.png)

   The ID is the name you want to give for your layer. It can be
   anything you want, but can only contain letters, numbers, dashes,
   and underscores, and it can’t have the same name as another layer in
   your project.

   You can apply any number of classes to your layer. A class helps
   you identify layers when doing CSS styling. For example, if you
   have many layers that all contain water polygons, you can give each
   layer the class “water.” Then you can use this class name to easily
   style them all at the same time in your CSS.

   The Datasource is the file you are loading in as a layer. This can
   be a CSV, shapefile, GeoJSON, KML, or GeoTIFF. In this example, we
   are using a shapefile containing polygons of the regions in the
   country of Georgia. This field must be supplied when creating a new
   layer.

   The SRS is the Spatial Reference System of your data. In most cases
   TileMill can automatically detect the correct SRS.

2. When you are finished with these options, click “Save” to add the
   new layer to the project. If you are following along, click “Save &
   Style.” This will automatically create a basic style for the new
   layer.

3. On the layers tab find your new layer and click the “Zoom to extent”
   button.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image24.png)

4. This will zoom to the new layer. If you selected “Save & Style” it
   will come with some basic styling.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image19.png)

Notice that the new layer is displayed above all the other layers.
If you wanted it, for example, to be displayed beneath the labels,
you can grab the icon next to it on the layers tab, and drag it
below the country-name layer. Remember that you must save the
project before the map will be updated.

### Add Your OSM Database

1. Now let’s see how we can add the PostGIS database that we filled
   with OpenStreetMap data in Chapter 1 of this Manual. Go to the
   Layers tab and click “Add Layer.”

2. Click on the “PostGIS” button.
   
   This is similar to the way we added a shapefile layer above. The
   main difference is that we need to supply the connection parameters
   to our PostGIS database.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image26.png)

3. Next to “Connection”, enter the following:

     host=localhost dbname=osm user=postgres password=my_password

   Replace my_password with your actual password.

4. Next to “Table or subquery”, enter: `planet_osm_roads`
   
   Note that you could also enter 
   `planet_osm_point`, `planet_osm_line`, or `planet_osm_polygon`.

5. Lastly, you will need to change the SRS to WGS84.

6. Click on “Save & Style,” and your new layer should be added to the
   project, along with some basic styling. Zoom to the layer extent to
   see how it looks.
   
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image31.png)

### JOSM Plugin

TileMill has a JOSM plugin which can be used to launch JOSM and load
OpenStreetMap data for the area that you are currently viewing. This
can be useful if you are using OSM data and you notice mistakes that you
want to correct while you are styling your maps. You may skip this
section if you don’t think you will need it, but here we will
demonstrate how to activate this plugin:

1. Go to the Plugins tab and Install JOSM Editor.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image01.png)

2. Open JOSM. Note that you must have the Remote Control feature
   enabled in the JOSM preferences.

3.  In TileMill, navigate to the area that you want to edit.
    Click ¨Edit in JOSM¨.
    
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image00.png)

4. JOSM will begin to download the OpenStreetMap data for the area that
   you are viewing in TileMill. You can make your edits to the OSM
   data and upload your changes to the server.

Note that the edits you make will not show up in TileMill, because
you have edited the main OSM database. You would need to update the
data you are using in TileMill in order to incorporate the latest
changes to OpenStreetMap.

Styling with CartoCSS
-----------------------------

Now it’s time for the fun part, styling our map! As mentioned
previously, TileMill uses a language called CartoCSS to style the map
data. If you are at all familiar with CSS, CartoCSS will be familiar to
you. If you’re not familiar with CSS, it will be quite understandable
anyway.

With TileMill you are allowed to style different types of layers in
different ways. For Line Layers you can style the line and labels,
create a pattern to go inside the line, add markers, and add a shield,
as when you want to put a number on a road. For Polygon Layers you can
style the polygon and labels, create a pattern inside the polygon or
inside the outlining line and add markers. For Points Layers you can
style the points and labels, and add shields or markers.

Note that there are different files in the Geography Class project.
Creating multiple files is simply a matter of convenience, because they
are all compiled into the same stylesheet in the end anyway. But it’s a
good idea to keep certain styling information together - for example,
all the labels in one file, and so forth.

### Line Styling

Let’s start out with line styling. When we added the
planet_osm_roads layer from our PostGIS database, TileMill
automatically created some basic styling at the bottom of the
style.mss file.

    #planetosmroads {
     line-width:1;
     line-color:#168;
    }

This code is fairly simple. `#planetosmroads` is what is known as a
selector. In this case, we are saying, “select everything with the ID
planetosmroads and apply the following styles.” After we have used this
selector to define what we want to style, we apply some basic styles.
`line-width:1;` indicates that the lines should be one pixel thick.
`line-color:\#168;` indicates that the lines should be a bluish color.
Colors are defined using hex, and may be in the format `#xxx` or
`#xxxxxx`.

Note that if you define the same style for a layer more than once, the
last style you define will be used. So:

    #planetosmroads {
     line-width:1;
     line-color:#168;
    }
    
    #planetosmroads {
     line-width:1;
     line-color:#861;
    }

would cause the layer to be colored with `#861`. The first declaration
will be ignored.

There are many declarations that you can make for lines. Here is an
example:

    #planetosmroads {
     line-width: 0.5;                 // sets the line width to 0.5 pixels
     line-color: #1a6e8a;             // sets the line color to #1a6e8a
     line-opacity: 0.8;               // makes the line 80% opaque (20% transparent)
     line-join: round;                // lines will be rounded at the end
     line-dasharray: 6,2,2,2;         // lines will be a series of dashes; in this
                                      // case, the dashes will go 6px line, 2px empty, 
                                      // 2px line, 2px empty, and then repeat
    }

### Polygon Styling

Styling polygons is quite similar to styling lines. Note that you can
use all of the same attributes that you used for lines, in addition to
new attributes. This is because when a polygon is drawn, it has
characteristics both for the style inside the polygon, and for the
outline drawn around it. Thus, any line attributes provided for a
polygon will be applied to its outline. Let’s look at an example:

    #georgia_regions {
     line-color:#000;
     line-dasharray: 6,6;
     line-width:0.5;
     polygon-opacity:0.5;
     polygon-fill:#ae8;
    }

This causes the layer to look like this:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image15.png)

Note that the line attributes affect the polygon outline. We use
`polygon-fill` to affect the color inside the polygons, and
`polygon-opacity` to change their transparency.

### Point Styling

For points layers, you will often want to use your own icons to
represent points. This can easily be done by supplying the path of your
icon in the CartoCSS file. For example:

    #cities {
     point-file: url(icons/star-10.png);
    }

You can get a complete list of style attributes by clicking on the
parentheses button in the lower left of TileMill.

*A Word About Tiles*

*Let’s take a moment to understand the way that slippy maps work, to
better grasp what we mean by zoom levels. You may have noticed in the
upper left corner of the map are buttons that allow you to zoom in and
out, and also the word “Zoom” with a number next to it.*

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image22.png)

*This indicates the current zoom level of the map. This can range from 0
up to 22, depending on your project settings. The higher the zoom
level, the further you are zoomed into the map. If you go out to zoom
level 0, you’ll see the whole world.*

*As we mentioned in the introduction, slippy maps work because they
create a whole lots of little image tiles at different zoom levels.
Each tile is an image 256 pixels by 256 pixels. At zoom level 0,
TileMill only generates one tile, and the whole world is contained on
it. At zoom level 1, that one tile is divided into four tiles. At zoom
level 2, each of the four tiles is divided into four more, resulting in
16 tiles. This pattern continues for as menu zoom levels as you want.*

Zoom Level 0 - One Tile
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image08.png)

Zoom Level 1 - Four Tiles 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image17.png)

*Zoom levels are important to understand when styling, because as we’ll
see in the next section, sometimes you want different styles to show at
different zoom levels.*

***

### Complex Selectors

We discussed selectors a little bit previously, but now let’s learn how
to use them to get more out of our maps. We already saw how we can use
layer IDs to select specific layers and apply style declarations:

    #cities {
     point-file: url(icons/star-10.png);
    }

What if we want to select only some of the features in that layer, based
on the data? We can change our selector and pass in an argument using
our data table. The following will display stars icons for only the
cities in Uruguay:

    #cities[SOV0NAME='Uruguay'] {
     point-file: url(icons/star-10.png);
    }

The same can be done for any column in the attribute table of a layer.
The `labels.mss` file already uses this type of selector for the cities
styling:

    #cities[ADM0CAP=1][zoom\>3] {
     ...
    }

This selector adds another element, the zoom level. Using this type of
selector, we can easily tell TileMill at what zoom levels we want the
styling to be displayed at. In the above example, any styling that is
inside the brackets will only be displayed when the user is zoomed in
past zoom level 3. This is why city names are not shown on the map when
you are zoomed all the way out.

Zoom Level 5
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image03.png)

Zoom Level 3
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image09.png)

You will notice another type of selector in the `rainbow.mss` style that
looks like this:

    #country::land-glow-outer[zoom>1] {
     line-color:#000;
     line-width:5;
     line-opacity:0.1;
     line-join:round;
    }

The layer that these declarations are affecting is \#country, and it is
set to function only above zoom level 1. But why does it have the
``::land-glow-outer``?

First, remember that the following code will cause the first statements
to be ignored:

    #country {
     line-color: #000;
     line-width: 6;
    }
   
    #country {
     line-color: \#999;
     line-width: 3;
    }

This will cause the appropriate lines to be 3 pixels wide and colored
`#999`. But sometimes you want to render the same layer multiple times.
For example if you want to draw a line that has an outline or a glow,
you will want TileMill to first draw a thick line, and then draw a
thinner line on top of it. To do this, you select the layers with
attachments. This is a way for you to render a layer using multiple
styles.

    #country::outline {
     line-color: #000;
     line-width: 6;
    }
    
    #country::fill {
     line-color: #999;
     line-width: 3;
    }
    

In this example, we use the attachments `::outline` and `::fill` to create
copies of the same layer, and render it twice. Hence, TileMill will
first draw the layer with the color \#000 and width of 6 pixels, and
then draw it again with a color \#999 and width of 3 pixels. In the
`rainbow.mss` file, this characteristic is used to create and outer and
inner glow for each country.

For more information on selectors click on the “Intro” tab of the Help.

### Color Variables

Variables are a convenience offered by CSS that allow us to keep our
color scheme all in one place. When writing lengthy CartoCSS, you will
often find that you reuse the same colors again and again for different
layers and different features. If you want to adjust those colors later
on, you have to go through and change every single value. Instead, you
can use variables to represent specific colors, and then use these
variables in the CartoCSS.

You’ll see this at the top of the `rainbow.mss` file:

    @white: #F0F8FF; /* blue-tinted, for Antarctica */
    @red: #fdaf6b;
    @orange: #fdc663;
    @yellow: #fae364;
    @green: #d3e46f;
    @turquoise: #aadb78;
    @blue: #a3cec5;
    @purple: #ceb5cf;
    @pink: #f3c1d3;
    @f00: #f00;

These are variable definitions. Any time you use the variables defined
here (such as `@green` or `@pink`) they will be replaced by the color values
that are defined.

### Comments

You can add comments into your CartoCSS files. Any text placed between
`/*` and `*/` will be ignored by TileMill. Also, anytime you use two
forward slashes, the remainder of the line will be considered a comment.
Example:

    /* This is
    a comment \*
    // this is a comment too!

Creating a Legend
--------------------------

1. It is easy to create a legend using HTML with TileMill. Simply click on
   the hand symbol in the lower right-corner to open the Legend Window.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image23.png)

2. On the “Legend” tab you’ll see the HTML code that makes up the legend
   bar in the lower right corner of the map. If you are comfortable
   writing HTML code, you can easily make this legend your own.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image14.png)

Exporting Your Map
----------------------

After you’ve designed a beautiful map using TileMill, you’re definitely
going to want to export it for the world to see. TileMill comes with
several options for exporting, as you can see when you click on the
“Export” button.

### Export a PNG Image File

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image25.png)

1. To export a PNG image file, click on “PNG.”

2. Choose the area you want to export by holding SHIFT on your keyboard
   and drawing an area on the map. You can zoom in if you need to.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image11.png)

3. In the panel on the right, you can change the name of the image
   file, and the dimensions in pixels of the image.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image05.png)

4. When you are finished click “Export.”

5. The image rendering will process and when it’s finished you can save
   the image by clicking on “Save.”
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch2_image07.png)

### Export MBTiles

MBTiles is a format for storing image tiles - all the little 256x256
images that make up the slippy map. In the next chapter we will see how
to upload MBTiles files to the web to easily publish our maps using
Development Seed’s MapBox platform.

1. To export tiles, click “MBTiles” on the Export menu.

2. Once again you can select the area that you would like to export by
   holding SHIFT and dragging a box on the map.

3. You will also want to adjust the zoom setting so that your file does
   not grow too big. Remember that every zoom level has four times as
   many tiles as the previous zoom level, so that number of image tiles
   grows exponentially. It will be best if you can keep your MBTiles
   file under 50MB for now.

Summary
---------------

In this chapter we learned how to use TileMill, a powerful application
for applying custom cartography to our maps. In the next chapter, we’ll
take a look at MapBox and see how we can deploy our beautiful maps on
the internet!
