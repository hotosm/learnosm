Putting Maps on a Website with MapBox
=========================================

In the last chapter we discovered the fundamentals of TileMill, and
finished by learning how to export tiles. Tiles, as you may recall, are
the essential component of a slippy map on the web. With tiles users
can easily pan the map around on a website and zoom in and out.

There are several ways to host tiles, but the easiest way is to use an
online hosting service like Development Seed’s MapBox. With this you
can create an account, upload your tiles, and easily embed maps into
your website. In this chapter, we’ll learn how to get started with
MapBox and how to easily embed our maps on webpage. We'll also look at
the MapBox plugins for Wordpress and Drupal.

Using MapBox
-----------------

MapBox is a platform designed by Development Seed to make it as easy
as possible to design and display custom maps on your website. 

1. To get started with MapBox, visit [http://mapbox.com/](http://mapbox.com/) 
   and click “Sign Up.” There are different pricing options you can select
   when signing up for MapBox - the more you spend the more storage
   space and map views you are allowed. For now, go ahead and sign up
   for a free account, which comes with more than enough to get
   started.

2. Note that with an account you agree to “grant MapBox a
   non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable right and
   license (with the right to sublicense), to use, copy, cache,
   publish, display, distribute, modify, create derivative works, and
   store such Subscriber Content and to allow others to do so (“Content
   License”) in order to provide the Services” (Terms of Service). You
   may not wish to use data that is private and/or sensitive.

3. Once you have signed up you will need to confirm your account by
   clicking the link that MapBox emails to you. Then you will be able
   to create maps.

4. Once you’ve logged in, click “New Map” to create a map.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch3_image08.png)

5. This creates a new project in which you can edit the styles of the
   map.
   ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch3_image03.png)

6. Zoom in to an area of interest and adjust the settings on the left
   panel. You can change the colors of streets, areas, water and land
   by clicking on the color settings next to each item.

7. Play around with the controls on the left. If you move to the
   “Info” tab, you can edit some of the settings of your map.

8. If you move to the markers tab, you can create markers on your map
   to identify specific locations. To add a marker to the map click
   “Place” and click on the map.

9. Notice that each time you edit a setting, the map image on the left
   reloads to reflect your changes. For detailed help on the map
   styling, you can visit the MapBox help at 
   [http://mapbox.com/help/#creating_a_new_map](http://mapbox.com/help/#creating_a_new_map).

10. You can save your map by clicking the “Save” button, and you can get
    an embeddable link for your web page by clicking on “Embed.” When
    you copy and paste the html into your website, the map you have
    saved here will be shown in a window on your site.

Uploading Tiles from TileMill
------------------------------------

The editing features of MapBox are somewhat limiting, but the real power
lies in the ability to host the tiles that you create in TileMill. You
can upload MBTiles files to your MapBox account in two ways.

1. Click on “Upload Layer” on your main MapBox page or on the Tool dropdown
   menu. ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch3_image07.png)

2. Here you can upload an MBTiles file that you have exported from
   TileMill.

3. Alternatively, you can directly upload your tiles from TileMill to your
   MapBox account. To do this, go to Export->Upload in TileMill. You
   will need to adjust the settings just as if you were exporting an
   MBTiles file. The first time you do this you will need to login in with
   your MapBox account credentials.

4. Once you have uploaded your TileMill tiles, you will see the project on
   your MapBox page.

5. You can open your project on the MapBox website and toggle some of the
   controls. You can turn the legend on or off and other aspects of the
   map.

Adding the Map to Your Site
---------------------------------

You’ve already seen how to embed a map using HTML, but if you have a
site built on a common CMS, there may be a MapBox plugin that will
easily allow you to add maps to your site.

### MapBox on WordPress

Putting your map into your website is easy with Wordpress. Simply find
the MapBox plugin and install it. The plugin can be found at
[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mapbox/](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mapbox/).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch3_image01.png)

This plugin will allow you to copy the embed codes (the \<iframe...bit)
into WordPress and allow you to easily add maps to your posts.

### MapBox on Drupal

To add MapBox maps to Drupal posts, you can paste the embed code
directly in. However, be sure to look for the editing format “Full
HTML” or “Extended HTML,” because otherwise Drupal may not allow you to
use `<iframe>` tags. Go
to[http://mapbox.com/help/#embedding_on_drupal](http://mapbox.com/help/#embedding_on_drupal)
for more information.

### Custom APIs

If you would like to do more than simply put your map up, you can check
out the API guide. This details ways you can change the workflow,
styling and other elements of your map. See detailed information at
[http://mapbox.com/help/](http://mapbox.com/help/).

### Static Maps

You can always export static images from TileMill and embed them in your
site. To do this, you will export a map image from TileMill and put it
on your website the same way that you would add a photograph or other
graphic.

In the previous chapter we covered some of the export options that
TileMill offers. By clicking on the export button in the upper right
corner you can export as a PNG file, which is an image file.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en_adv_ch3_image00.png)

Once you have exported a PNG from TileMill, you can embed it in your
website. If you are using raw html, simply add an image tag:

    <img src=“IMAGE_PATH” alt=“My Map”>

Replace IMAGE_PATH with the path to the image file, including the .png
extension.

If you are using a CMS like WordPress, you should be able to upload the
image using the CMS image manager.

Summary
--------------

In the past two chapters we’ve seen how we can design beautiful maps
based on OpenStreetMap data and other custom data, and how we can create
images and tiles that can be easily hosted online.
