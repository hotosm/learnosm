OruxMaps
===============

In this section, we will learn how to set up OruxMaps,
how to create waypoints, how to see a tracklog, and how to export a
tracklog for use in JOSM.

​Install OruxMaps
------------------

Install the app from Google Play Store by searching for **OruxMaps**,
OruxMaps should be among the top search results listed.

![Search OruxMaps in Play Store][]

Click on **Install** button and press Accept after App permissions appears.

![Install OruxMaps][]

Congratulations! You  now have OruxMaps installed in your device!

​Using OruxMaps
--------------------

The first time you run the application, you will see a notification like
this:

In OruxMaps, you can choose whether you want to use online maps or
offline maps. It’s better to use offline maps since you can use it even
without an Internet connection. OruxMaps will suggest two sources  for
downloading offline maps. If you already have your offline maps, you can
also put in here too! At first it can be a little bit confusing
because there are so many buttons in there. But don’t worry, you will
see the explanation for each buttons below:

Version](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oruxmaps.com%2Foruxmapsmanual_en.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFY7Tk-Gzz9NFKy9WOsnfnn8x3Kwg)

You can change your background map under **Maps \> Switch Maps**. After that
you get to options - you want to use your **Online Map** or you want to use
**Offline Maps**. OruxMaps provide a lot of Online Maps source that can you
choose but of course it will cost money from the data plan on your device.  If you want
to know where you can put your offline maps, you can go to **Setting \>
Maps**. In the map directory option you can see where the OruxMaps put your
offline maps. By the default, it’s in **OruxMaps/Mapfiles** folder in your
internal storage.

Start Tracking
-------------------

Before you start tracking let’s review some settings under track/routes
setting. The first setting is **Auto GPX Creation**. If you check this setting,
OruxMap will help you to create .gpx file immediately after finishing a
track (using Stop Tracking feature). So, after finishing a track, you
can go to **OruxMaps/Tracklogs** in your internal storage to get your .gpx
files without needing to export your track log first in track/routes
management. The second setting is **Ask Track Name**. It’s very useful to
define your track name before you start tracking so that you exactly
know the specific name of your tracks.

![Tracklog settings][]

To start tracking, one thing to remember is that we must set GPS
Features in your device on. Any features in OruxMaps like **Start GPS** and
**Start Rec** will not start unless you activate the GPS Features. OruxMaps
will show notification if your GPS still disabled, and after that you
will directly go to **Location Setting** in your device. After you turn on
Location feature in your device, you can know your location by using
**Start GPS** (1) feature in the right panel. After your location is already
acquired, you can start Tracking by using **Start Rec.** (2) in the right
Panel.

![Start track recording][]

To stop tracking you only need to press the same button (2) in the right
panel. After you stop tracking OruxMap will store your tracklog in an
internal  database. You can access the tracklog by accessing
**Routes** panel in top page, select **Manage**.You will find all of your
tracklog here and you can see the route by press the tracklog that you
want to see and select **Load the Track** (1). If you don’t use Auto GPX
creation feature you can export your tracklog in various format (GPX,
KML, KMZ) by select your tracklog and **Export as** (2).  

![Managing tracklogs][]

If you already have an OpenStreetMap account, you can upload your track
directly using OruxMaps. Before you upload your tracklog you need to put
your username and password by going to **Setting \> Integration \>
OpenStreetMap**. After that enter your username and password. You can upload
your tracklog by using **Upload to (3)** in track/routes management. 

Some windows will pop up and you need to select **OpenStreetMaps** (1) and after
that you choose your **Tracklog type** (2), put your **Description** (3) and
also the **Tag** (4). After all the information already filled up press
**Upload GPX** (5). The notification will pop up and you can directly see
your GPS traces on the OpenStreetMap website by selecting **OK** (6).

​Adding Waypoint
---------------------

![Creating a waypoint][]

If you want to add waypoint, you need to go to **Waypoint** symbol (1) at
the top of the page and go to **Create** (2). It will bring you to waypoint
creation page and fill your waypoint name. You can add extra information,
for example a description of your waypoint and coordinates of
your waypoint by checking the Coordinates checklist. Press Accept to save
your waypoint.

![Waypoint creation settings][]

If you want to see all of your waypoints, you can go to **Waypoint \>
Manage**. From this page you can change the properties, delete and export
the waypoint. To see all of your waypoints in **map**, select the waypoints
and go to show in map (1) and if you want to export your waypoints press
**Export** (2). All of your exported waypoints will be stored in internal
storage (by the default it stored in **oruxmaps/geocaches**).
