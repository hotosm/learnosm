Go Map!! is an iOS app that lets you create and edit information in OpenStreetMap.
Go Map!! supports editing ways and arbitrary tagging.

You can download it for free from the App Store.

Walk Through
---------------

When you first start Go Map!!, it will prompt to use your device's GPS to determine
your location. Say "allow" and it will zoom to your position and download the satellite
and OpenStreetMap data near you. If you live in a densely mapped area, it may take a
few moments to download, and if you live in a sparsely mapped area, you may need to
zoom out a bit to see details. Simply pinch zoom and drag to pan around your immediate
neighborhood. Go Map!! automatically downloads additional data as needed as you
pan around your location.

![Home][]

OpenStreetMap uses the term 'node' to describe simple points, which typically indicate
smaller objects like trees or small shops, while 'ways' are larger objects with size,
such as highways or buildings. Go Map!! indicates a node with an icon or a small square,
while ways are displayed as lines, rectangles or polygons.

Adding OSM Data
---------------

### Adding tags
Tags are used to describe objects in the OpenStreetMap database, such as indicating that
a location contains a shop or restaurant and what its name is. To select an existing object,
either a node or a way, simply tap it. To select a building, you must select the outline of
the building instead the center. Selected objects are highlighted in yellow and its tag is
displayed (gray box) and a configuration button. Press the "Tags" button to view and edit tags.

![Adding tags][]

The tag editing screen presented has three tabs of views. The first tab, Common Tags, presents
fields for adding common points of interest.

![Common Tags][]

The second tab, All Tags", allows advanced usersto add arbitrary tags and values. 

![All Tags][]

The third tab shows metadata about the object: who created it and when, and additional low-level
details. From this tab, you can also drill down to information stored on the OSM server about
the user, changeset, object history, and object details.

+ Identifier - object page
+ User - user page
+ Version - object history page
+ Changeset - changeset page

### Move a node, a way, or a node in a way
To move a node or a way, tap to select it, and it will be highlighted in yellow. To select a node
that is part of a way, first, select the way, then tap a node in it. 

![node in a way][]

Once selected, drag the title box (gray box) to move it to a new location. Confirm the move
if prompted. If you make a mistake, use the Undo button, or simply move it back.

### Create, move and tag a POI
To create a new node or point of interest, tap the "+" button. A pin will drop indicating the 
position of your new node. 

![New node][]

Drag it using the title bar to the correct location, then press the "Tags" button to add tags.
If you don't add any tags, then your  new node will be discarded, so if you drop a pin by accident,
simply tap elsewhere and it will disappear.

![Add tag to the node][]

### Add a node to a way
If you wish to add nodes to a way, there are two approaches, depending on whether you are
adding the node to the middle of the way or extending it at either end.

To add a node to the middle of the way, select the way by tapping close to the position where
you want the new node to appear, then press "+". A node will be added to the selected location.

![Middle node][]

To append a node to the end of a way, select the way, then select a node at either end, then press "+".
A new node will be added to the start or end of the way.

![End node][]

### Create a way/area
Creating a new way or area is similar to creating a node, except you press "+" twice. On the first press
of "+", a pin will drop which you can position as desired. Tap "+" again to add the second node connected
to the first node. Position the second node and continue pressing "+" to add additional nodes.

![Create way]

To create an area, simply drop a final node and then drag it on the top of the first node. A circle
of dots will indicate that it is joining to the existing node. You can also join to existing ways by
dragging over them.

![Create area][]

### Undo/Redo
Any time you make an error, you can use the undo button to revert your changes. All actions including tag
changes can be undone, or redone, even if you exit the app and restart later. After uploading to the
server all undo actions are discarded. You cannot undo after uploading.

### Upload changes
When you are finished making your changes to the map, you can submit your changes to the OpenStreetMap
server by pressing the upload (cloud) button. 

![Cloud][]

If the change is uploaded successfully, you will simply be returned to the map screen. After uploading,
you cannot undo to a previous state; all changes are final.

Searching for Places
---------------
Press the GPS button to zoom to and track your current location. Press it again to turn off GPS. Press
and hold the GPS button to perform a nomatim search of places or landmarks you wish to zoom in.



Setting the Background Display
-------------

Like using the OSM editors such as  iD or JOSM, Go Map!! allows us to use different
backgrounds that can guide us in editing data. You can change the background to show just
the editing layer while you may select "Editor with Aerial" if you want to use aerial
imagery as the background for editing.

![Display][]

You also have the option to select what aerial imagery to use while editing.
By selecting the text beside "Aerial only", choose which imagery you wish to use.

![Custom Aerial][]

You may also customize with your own imagery by selecting "Add New" and entering the name and the
URL of the imagery on the URL text box. You need to define the tile servers and
max zoom for this imagery.

![Aerial Provider][]

Select "Clear Cache" if you want to clear the OSM data cache. It can be used 
if you have downloaded a bit too much data for your iOS device to handle and things
are becoming sluggish. 

Clearing the OSM data cache is helpful especially if the application state becomes
out of sync with the OSM server. This may occur if someone else changes data you are editing,
or if one of your uploads fails midway through preventing from uploading
additional data.

> Clearing the OSM cache will cause you to lose any changes that have not
yet been uploaded.

Clear the Mapnik or Overlay tile caches to download the latest tiles that reflect
changes you've previously submitted. Your changes may take up to 24 hours to be
processed.

![Clear Cache][]

You may also overlay different information such as GPX Tracks, Notes & Fixmes,
OpenStreetMap GPS Traces, and Unnamed Roads. Plus, you can enable rotation of the
app and enable 3-D effects of the OSM data.

![Overlays][]

Setting the Settings and miscellaneous
-------------

Go Map!! requires you to be a registered user on openstreetmap.org in order to
upload changes you make to the map. You are required to provide tour openstreetmap.org
name and password to the application before uploading data.

Under the Settings icon, select OpenStreetMap Login and type your OSM username
and password. If you don't have an OSM account, kindly select "Register new
account" and follow the instructions. Select "Verify" once you're done.

![Verify][]

You can also find other mappers nearby by selecting "Nearby Mappers". This shows
everyone that has edited the area in your current view. Zoom in to see fewer people
or zoom out to see more.

![Nearby mappers][]

"Prepare fo Offline" option downloads Bing and/or Mapnik tiles for offline use if you
expect to be mapping an area without cellular connectivity. Alternatively you can simply
scroll around the area you plan to be visiting: all Bing, Mapnik and OpenStreetMap data
is cached and will be available even if you have no connectivity. Once you have an
access to the internet, simply upload as usual.

When displaying Bing aerial imagery, click the Bing logo to retrieve Bing copyright and
data provider information.
