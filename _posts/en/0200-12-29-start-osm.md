Getting started on OpenStreetMap.org
====================================

In this chapter we will learn step by step how to navigate the
OpenStreetMap website, view and print maps, and sign up for a user
account. After you have your own username and password, you will be able
to add your first points to the map.

Visit the OpenStreetMap Website
-------------------------------

-   Be sure that your computer is on and you are connected to the
    internet.
-   To visit the OpenStreetMap website, you need to open your web
    browser. Start your browser – Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Internet
    Explorer.
-   In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following
    text: www.openstreetmap.org
-   When the page has finished loading, you should see something like
    this:

    ![OpenStreetMap website with some main functions listed][]

Navigate the Map
----------------

-   The main thing you should see is the map. Move the map by clicking
    on it with your left mouse button, holding the button down, and
    dragging your mouse around (see figure below)
-   If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, zoom in and out on the map
    by turning the wheel. If you don’t have a scroll-wheel, use the +
    and – buttons on in the upper right corner of the map. (see figure
    below)
-   To search for a place, left-click in the box labelled “Search” on
    the left side of the page (see figure above). Type in the name of
    your town or village and press Enter. A window should appear to the
    left of the map with the results of your search. Click on the
    location that looks like the one you want. The map will
    automatically move to the location you chose.

    ![Mouse navigation][]

Save an Image of the Map
------------------------

-   If you want to save an image from OpenStreetMap that you can easily
    print, follow these instructions.

    ![Exporting a map][]

-   Just above the map, click on the button labeled “Export”. A new
    panel will appear next to the map.
-   In the new window, make sure the button is highlighted next to
    “Mapnik Image”.
-   Click “Export” at the bottom of the new window. A download will
    start. Save it to your computer.
-   Open the file that you downloaded. If you would like to print the
    map, you can select “Print” from the File menu, after connected your
    computer to a printer.

Create an OpenStreetMap Account
-------------------------------

-   Now that you have seen what the main website looks like, you can
    register for a username and password and make your first additions
    to the map.
-   Go back to the OpenStreetMap website. Click “sign up” in the top
    right corner of the page.
-   You should see a new page that looks like this:

    ![Registering an OpenStreetMap account][]

-   There are five boxes on this page that you need to fill in to
    register an account with OSM.
-   Enter your email address in the first two boxes. You should enter
    the same email address in both boxes. Later, you will need to open
    your email to confirm your account with OpenStreetMap.
-   In the third box, enter the username that you would like to have.
    You will not be able to choose a username that someone else has
    chosen before, so it should be creative. If you try to enter
    something simple, like your first name, it is likely that someone
    has already claimed that name.
-   Enter a new password in the fourth and fifth boxes. You should enter
    the same password in both boxes. It does not need to be the same as
    the password for your email.
-   You will want to remember your user name and your password so that
    you can login later. You may want to write down your OSM username
    and password.
-   After you have completed all the boxes, click “Continue” at the
    bottom of the page.
-   If there are any problems, an error message may pop up. Check to
    make sure that your email is the same in the first to boxes, and
    your password is the same in the bottom two boxes. If the third box
    is highlighted red, it means that someone else has already chosen
    your username, and you should try a different name.
-   Open a separate window or tab in your internet browser, and navigate
    to your email.  Common email sites are [mail.yahoo.com](http://mail.yahoo.com)
    and [www.gmail.com](http://www.gmail.com).
-   Enter your email address and your email password to open your email.
    Note that this is __not___ the same as your OpenStreetMap username and
    password.
-   If everything was successful with your registration, you should see
    an email from OpenStreetMap in your inbox. Open the email. It should
    look like the image below. Click on the link that is identified
    below:

    ![Confirming your OpenStreetMap account][]

-   A new tab or window will open. If everything went well, you should
    have an OSM account!
-   On the OpenStreetMap page, click “log in” in the top right corner.
    Enter your OpenStreetMap username and password and press Enter. You
    should now be logged in. You should see your username in the upper
    right corner of the page.

Adding Your First Points
------------------------

-   Now that you are logged in with your username on the OpenStreetMap
    website, you can use the Potlatch editor to add your first point to
    the map.
-   Move the map to a place that you know very well, such as your town
    or village.
-   Zoom in to a place where you would like to add a point to the map.
-   Just above the map on the left, there is a tab marked “Edit”. Hover
    your mouse over this button, but don’t click. You should see a menu
    drop down.
-   Click “Edit with Potlatch 2 (in-browser editor).
-   The online editor for OpenStreetMap should open. If a window pops
    up, press “OK”
-   You can add a point to the map by clicking on an icon on the left,
    and dragging it to its location on the map. After you add the point
    and are satisfied that it is correct, click “Save” in the upper
    right corner.
-   NOTE: If you are not sure about the accuracy of the point(s) you
    add, don’t click “Save”! Play around with the Potlatch editor, but
    don’t save your changes.

Summary
-------

Congratulations! If all went well you now have an OpenStreetMap username
and password, you know how to navigate the OSM website, and you have
your first understanding of how to add points to the map.

In the next chapter, we will install a desktop editor for OpenStreetMap,
called JOSM, and learn how to draw maps and add places with symbols to 
the map.
