Using the GPS
=============

Introduction
------------

In this chapter we will see what a GPS does and how it works. You will
learn how to operate a GPS, and how to use it to create maps. In this
chapter we will explain how to operate the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx, a
common GPS used for mapping. There are many other models of GPS which do
the same thing, so if you are working with a different one, don’t worry
– the principles remain the same.

What is GPS?
------------

A GPS is like a mobile phone, except that instead of receiving radio
signals from telephone companies, it receives signals from satellites
that are going around the Earth. By receiving these signals from the
satellites, a GPS is able to calculate your exact location on the
planet. It records this location in coordinates, which are two long
numbers. One number tells you how far East or West you are – this is
called longitude. The second number tells you how far North or South you
are – this is called latitude. Every place on Earth has unique
geographic coordinates.

For example: -8.639298 Latitude, 116.311607 Longitude is a location in
Lombok, Indonesia.

Turn on the GPS
---------------

Before you turn on your GPS, go outside where you have a clear view of
the sky. Because the GPS determines your location by receiving signals
from satellites, it won’t work indoors. On the right side of your GPS,
press and hold the Power button. The GPS will start, and it will show
you the Satellites page. You should see something like the image below.
Your GPS is looking for satellite signals. When it has connected to
three or more satellites, it will have your location.

and you will see the main menu. ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/aquiring_satellites.jpeg)

Navigate the GPS
----------------

-   The GPS has different screens and menus that allow you to do
    different things. To switch between screens, press the button marked
    “X”, just above the power button on the right side of the device.
    This button also serves to go back. If you press something by
    mistake and would like to cancel or go back, press the “X” button.
-   By pressing the X button, you should be able to flip through
    different screens that will look something like this:

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/aquiring_satellites.png)
-   If you return to the Satellites page, you can see that you are
    connected to three or more satellites. In the upper left corner are
    your coordinates, your latitude and longitude.
-   Flip to the Map page, and you can see a map of where you are. If you
    have added OSM maps to your GPS, you may see roads and places.
    Otherwise, the map may look quite blank. Zoom in and out by pressing
    the up and down arrow buttons on the left side of the GPS.

Tracks and Waypoints
--------------------

Your GPS records two kinds of information that are useful for creating
maps or saving the coordinates of a place. First, it allows you to save
your location in the memory of the GPS. When you save a location, the
coordinates will be saved with a name. For example, your first saved
point will be named 001, the second 002, and so on. When you save a
point, you can write down the number on a piece of paper, along with a
note about what it is, any any attribute or indicators you would like to
know. Saved locations on your GPS are called waypoints.Second, your GPS
can save what are called tracks. While a waypoint only saves a single
location, a track will save a series of locations wherever you move. For
example, the track will record your location every one second, or every
one meter, and the result will be a series of dots that show the path of
where you have been. Tracks are useful for mapping objects that are
represented by lines or shapes, such as the course of a road, or the
shape of a field.

![A GPS can record a single point as well as a path of where you travel.
Here the points are numbered in the order they are recorded. The path,
or “track”, is shown in red. ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/gps_google_earth.jpeg)

Save Your Location
------------------

-   To save your current location as a waypoint, click the “X” button
    until your reach the Main Menu. Using the joystick, move it so that
    “Mark” is highlighted on the screen. Push the joystick button down
    to open the “Save Waypoint” page.

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/save_location1.jpeg)
![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/save_location2.jpeg)
-   You can see on this page some information about the waypoint that
    you are saving. First is the name. If this is your first waypoint,
    it probably reads “001”. This is the number you should record on
    paper along with the information you want to collect with this
    object. Next you will see the time and date when the point is
    recorded. Below that are the coordinates, followed by the altitude.
-   Use the joystick to move to the “OK” button at the bottom of the
    screen. Press the joystick button down to save this point. Be sure
    to write down the number of the point, along with what the place is
    and any other information you want to record about the place in your
    notebook.
-   Press the “X” button to go to the map page. You should now see your
    point on the map.

Turn on the Track Log
---------------------

-   Now that we have learned how to save points, let’s learn how to turn
    the track log on and off. When the track log is turned on, it will
    automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the
    log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished.
    You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the
    path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road,
    it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the
    road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and
    any other important information about the road.
-   To turn on the track log, click the “X” button until your reach the
    page that says Track Log.

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/turn_on_track.jpeg)
-   If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier
    recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the
    joystick down. The bar at the top should read “0%”
-   To turn on the log, move the joystick to highlight “On”, and press
    the joystick down. The track log is now recording your path.
-   Press the “X” button to go to the map page. As you move you will see
    your track shown as a series of dots.

Copy Waypoints and Tracks to the Computer
-----------------------------------------

Attach GPS to the Computer
--------------------------

-   When you are finished mapping with the GPS you will want to copy the
    points and tracks to your computer so that you can open them in
    JOSM. First, turn off the track log on your GPS, by going to the
    track page and selecting “Off”.
-   Attach the GPS to your computer with the cable. One end should plug
    into your computer’s USB port, and the other goes into the back of
    the GPS, beneath the rubber flap at the top. The GPS should be
    turned on to copy the points and tracks.

Install GPS Drivers
-------------------

-   You may need to install GPS drivers on your computer. If you have a
    copy of USBDrivers\_23.exe on your computer, double-click it and
    install.
-   If you don’t have this file, you can download it. Open your internet
    browser and go to:
    [http://www8.garmin.com/support/download\_details.jsp?id=591](http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=591)

- Click “Download” to get the installation file. Locate it on your
computer, and double-click to install. Get the GPSBabel Setup Program
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ -
GPSBabel is a program that allows us to copy data from the GPS. If you
have a copy of GPSBabel on a CD or usb flash drive, you can skip to
section 7.4. - If you don’t have GPSbabel already, open your web browser
and go to www.gpsbabel.org - Click “Downloads” at the top of the page. -
Scroll down the page. If your computer uses Windows, you want to
download the installation file for Windows. Click
“GPSBabel-1.4.2-Setup.exe”. The file will be downloaded to your

Copy Tracks and Waypoints
-------------------------

-   Click in the circle next to the word “Device” at the top of the
    window.
-   In the dropdown menu labelled “Format”, select “Garmin serial/USB
    protocol”
-   Go down to the middle of the window, under Output. In the dropdown
    menu labelled “Format”, select “GPX XML”:

![Choose GPX XML ]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/gpx_xml.png)

-   Click “File Name” and type a name for your saved file. It should be
    something that describes the data, such as the date and the
    location. For example, jakarta-07-07-2011
-   Make sure your GPS is connected to the computer and turned on.
-   Click “Apply” in the bottom right corner of the window.

- If all goes well you should see a bar move across the screen,
indicating that the data is being retrieved from the GPS. When it is
finished, your points and track will be saved in the file that you
selected. Open in JOSM \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ - Now open
JOSM. On the top menu, click “File” and then click “Open…” - Find and
select the file that you created with GPSBabel. Click “Open”. - You
should now see your points and tracks loaded into JOSM.

Summary
-------

Congratulations! You should now have an understanding of how to use the
GPS. If you haven’t already, practice saving points of some important
locations. In this chapter you learned how to open your points and
tracks in JOSM. In Chapter 6, we will use this information to add new
places to OpenStreetMap.In the next chapter, we will learn about Walking
Papers, which is another way of collecting information for
OpenStreetMap. With Walking Papers, all you need is paper and a pen, and
you can collect the coordinates of places just like with a GPS.
