Editing OpenStreetMap with JOSM
===============================

Introduction
------------

In Chapter 3 you installed JOSM and began drawing your first points,
lines, and shapes. You added presets to these objects in order to attach
information about them. By the end, you were able to draw your own map
in JOSM.

Drawing maps in Chapter 3 was an exercise to learn JOSM and learn how to
draw places on the map. But our maps were not accurate, because we
hadn't yet included location. In the past two chapters we've examined
two tools, GPS and Walking Papers, which allow us to collect actual
locations of places. These locations are represented by coordinates.

Drawing a real map, that is, a map where all the points, lines, and
shapes are in their proper location, is no different than drawing the
maps we drew in chapter 3. But now, we will use our GPS points and
tracks, and our Walking Papers, to draw similar maps at their correct
locations on the planet.

In this chapter we will learn how to edit the map on OpenStreetMap and
add our improvements. We'll learn the basic cycle of mapping on OSM:

1.  **download** the current map data from OSM
2.  **edit** it using GPS, Walking Papers, and notes as a guide
3.  **save** changes to OpenStreetMap

By the end of this chapter, we will be able to see our additions on the
OSM map.

Prepare JOSM
------------

-   To start JOSM, click on the Start Menu in the lower left corner of
    your computer, and find the program JOSM.
-   Now load your gpx file and you Walking Paper. You don't need to open
    both, but you can if you want. Refer to the previous two chapters if
    you don't remember how to open these in JOSM.

Download OSM Data
-----------------

-   Remember the cycle of editing OpenStreetMap described in the
    introduction of this chapter? **Download, edit, save.** Before we
    can edit the map, we must download the existing OSM data in our
    area.
-   When you open your gpx track or Walking Paper, the map window will
    show what you have opened, and will automatically move to the
    correct coordinates. After you open your files, look in the bottom
    left corner of JOSM. You can see the latitude and longitude
    (coordinates) of your mouse cursor.

-   Because our map window is already showing the area that we want to
    edit, it is easy to download the OpenStreetMap data for this area.
    Click on "File" in the top left corner of JOSM and click "Download
    from OSM". This will open up the download window. You can access
    this window more simply by clicking on the download button, shown
    here:

-   When the download window opens, you should see a map with a pink box
    drawn on it. If you don't see the map, click on the tab marked
    "Slippy map".

-   The pink box represents the area of the map that we would like to
    download for editing. Unless you have moved the map window since you
    opened your GPS file or Walking Papers, the box should be drawn
    around the correct area. However if you would like to download a
    larger area, you can draw a new box. To draw a new box, click on the
    map, hold your left mouse button down, and drag your mouse to create
    a box. Release the mouse button to finish drawing the box.
-   When you are satisfied with the size and location of the box, click
    "Download" at the bottom of the window. JOSM will get the data for
    this area from OpenStreetMap and open it in your map window for
    editing.

Edit
----

-   The next step is to edit the map and add new items. This is not
    always easy at first, but with practice you will get better and
    better.
-   If you want to move a point, line, or shape, use the **select
    tool.** Click on an object and drag it where it should be. This can
    be used to correct the location of items that have been put in the
    wrong place.

-   Use the **draw tool** to draw new points, lines, and shapes.
    Describe these objects by selecting from the Presets menu, as you
    did in Chapter 3.
-   Remember that your GPS points and your Walking Papers don't
    automatically go
-   into OpenStreetMap. You need to add them to the OSM map digitally,
    using the draw tool. But your points, tracks, and Walking Papers can
    be seen in the background as a guide.
-   Let's assume that you saved a waypoint on your GPS named 030, and
    you wrote in your notebook that 030 is a school. To add this point
    into OpenStreetMap, you should select the draw tool, and
    double-click on top of point 030 in your map window. This will
    create a point. Then go to the Presets menu, and find the preset for
    school. Enter the name of the school and click "Apply Preset". Do
    the same to add lines and shapes.

Upload Changes
--------------

-   After you have made a couple of changes to improve the map, let's
    save those changes to OpenStreetMap. To save the changes, we need to
    be connected to the internet, because we are in fact uploading the
    changes to OpenStreetMap.
-   Click "File" on the top menu, and then click "Upload Data". This
    will open up the upload window. You can access this window more
    simply by clicking on the upload button, shown here:

-   The window that appears shows a list of the objects that you are
    adding and the objects you are modifying or deleting. In the box at
    the bottom you are asked to provide a comment about the changes that
    you are making. Type in here a description of your edits.

-   Click "Upload Changes".
-   If this is your first time saving changes to OpenStreetMap, you will
    be asked for the username and password that you created in Chapter
    2. Enter them in the window that appears. If you check the box in
    this window, your username and password will be saved and you won't
    need to enter them again in the future. Click "Authenticate".

-   You will need to wait a few seconds for your changes to be uploaded,
    and then you are done! You have made your first edits to
    OpenStreetMap. You may continue editing to add all your points if
    you wish. Always be sure to upload your changes before you close
    JOSM.

See Your Changes on the Map
---------------------------

-   Open your internet browser and go to
    [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).
-   Move the map to the area that you edited.
-   You should see your changes now appearing on the map! If you don't,
    try pressing CTRL+R to refresh the web page. Sometimes the map
    doesn't update properly and needs to be reloaded.
-   What if you don't see your changes? Don't worry â€“ it may take a few
    minutes for the changes to be shown on the map. Also, check your
    additions in JOSM to make sure that you added them correctly. A good
    general rule is, if your point has an icon in JOSM, then it should
    be seen on the main map at the OpenStreetMap website.

Summary
-------

Now that you've seen how to add to OpenStreetMap, what's next? Remember
that OSM maps get better and better over time. Every time you make
improvements to the map, those changes remain and the data gets better
and better. And just as you can improve other people's work, so they can
improve your work too.

In the next chapter, we will go over some more advanced JOSM techniques.
We'll learn how to draw better shapes, how to use different tools, and
what all the buttons and windows are surround the map!
