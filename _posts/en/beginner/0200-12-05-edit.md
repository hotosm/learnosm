Advanced Editing
================

Introduction
------------

In the previous chapters you have learned how to draw points, lines, and
shapes in JOSM, how to open your GPS waypoints and tracks in JOSM, and
how to download, edit, and upload your changes on OpenStreetMap. In this
chapter, we will describe in more detail some of the features of JOSM,
so that you can beyond the simple editing tools and have a better
understanding of the software. Note that while this chapter is not
extremely advanced, it is a step higher than the previous chapters. If
you don’t feel like you fully understand the lessons leading up to this,
you may wish to practice a little bit more before continuing.

A Tour of JOSM
--------------

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_tour.png)
-   JOSM has many different features. The main window in JOSM you are
    already familiar with – this is the map window, and it is where most
    of the action takes place. Here you view, edit, and add to the
    OpenStreetMap data.
-   To the right of the map window are a series of panels, which each do
    something different. Typically when you first install JOSM several
    panels are shown by default, such as Layers, Properties, and
    Selection. When you select a point, line, or shape in the map
    window, it will be shown in the Selection panel. Information about
    the object will be shown in the Properties panel, and the username
    of the author of that object will be shown in the Authors panel.
-   On the left side of JOSM, there are several toolbars, which consist
    of many buttons. At the top of this bar are different buttons which
    change what you can do with your mouse. You are already familiar
    with the first two, the Select tool and the Draw tool. The other
    tools make it easier to zoom in, delete an object, draw a shape, or
    create a line that is parallel to another line.
-   Below these tools are many more buttons. These buttons control what
    you see on the right side of JOSM. Using these buttons you can open
    and close the boxes on the right, such as properties, selection, and
    author.

JOSM Layers
-----------

-   Open your GPS file and download data from OpenStreetMap, if you
    haven’t already. You may notice that when you open a file, or add
    Walking Papers, or download from OpenStreetMap, another item is
    added to the Layers panel on the right side of JOSM. Your Layers
    panel may look something like this:

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_layers.png)
-   Each item in this list represents a different source of data that
    you have open in your map window. In the example above, “Data Layer
    2” is the OpenStreetMap data that we want to edit. “Markers” are the
    waypoints from the GPS, and “30 Juni 2011.gpx” is the track from the
    GPS. Finally, “Walking Papers” is the layer created when I added my
    Walking Paper into JOSM. You can add the Bing imagery layer, which
    shows satellite imagery, by clicking “Imagery” on the top menu of
    JOSM and selecting “Bing Sat.”
-   To hide one of these layers, select one of them with your mouse and
    click the Show/Hide button that looks like this:

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_hide.png)
-   You should see the layer that you selected disappear in the map
    window. Click Show/Hide again, and it will reappear.
-   You can close a layer by selecting it and using the delete button:

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_delete.png)
-   Lastly, it’s important to know that you can only edit the layer that
    is considered active by JOSM. If you are unable to edit the map in
    your map window, it’s probably because you don’t have the correct
    layer set as active. Most layers, such as GPS points, Walking
    Papers, and satellite imagery, can’t be edited. The only layers that
    can be edited are data from OpenStreetMap, which are usually called
    “Data Layer 1”.
-   To make a layer active, select it in the Layers panel, and click on
    the Activate button:

Saving OSM files
----------------

-   Sometimes after you download some OSM data, you may wish to save it
    so that you can edit it offline, and then upload it later when you
    have internet access again.
-   To save an OSM file, make sure that it is the active layer in the
    the Layers panel. Click “File” on the top menu, and click “Save”.
    Choose a location for the file and give it a name. You can also save
    by clicking this button:

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_save.png)
-   You can now close JOSM and your data will be saved. When you want to
    open the file again, simply open JOSM, go to the “File” menu, and
    click “Open…”

Additional Drawing Tools
------------------------

-   JOSM has some additional tools to make it easier to draw lines and
    shapes. These tools are found in the “Tools” menu at the top of
    JOSM.

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_tools.png)
- In order to apply the functions in this menu, you must first select a
point, line or shape in the map window. Some of the most useful
functions are described here: Split Way This allows you to divide a line
into two separate lines. This is useful if you want to add different
attributes to different parts of a road. To use this function, select a
point in the middle of the line that you want to split, Select Split Way
from the Tools menu, and your line should be split in two. Combine Way
This does the opposite of Split Way. To combine two lines into a single
line, they must share a single point. To use this function, select both
lines that you want to combine. You can select more than one object by
holding the SHIFT key on your keyboard and clicking on each line. When
you have selected both lines, select Combine Way from the Tools menu.
Reverse Way This will change the direction of the line. If your line
represents a road that is one way, you may want to change its direction.
In other cases, direction doesn’t matter. Simplify Way If your line has
too many points in it and you’d like to make it simpler, this will
remove some of the points from a line. Align Nodes in Circle If you are
trying to make a circular shape, draw the circle as best you can and
then select this function. It will help arrange your points in a circle.
Align Nodes in Line This function will align a series of points into a
straight line. Orthogonalize Shape This function is very useful for
drawing buildings. After you draw a building, this function will reshape
it to have square corners.

Tags
----

-   When you draw a point, line, or shape, it is create with a location,
    but no information about what it is. In other words, we know where
    it is, but not what it is. Before now, we have been using items from
    the Presets menu to define what it is.
-   The way OpenStreetMap knows what an object is is by using tags. A
    tag is like a label that you can put on something. For example, if I
    draw a square, it’s only a square. But then I add multiple tags to
    it that describe what it is:
    -   this square is a building
    -   the name of the building is “Menara Thamrin”

    - the building is 16 levels high
-   You can add as many tags as you want to an object. Tags are saved as
    pairs of text, called the keys and the values. In OpenStreetMap, the
    tags written above would in fact be:
    -   building = yes
    -   name = Menara Thamrin

    - building:levels = 16
-   If you select an object in JOSM, you can see all the tags that are
    attached to it in the Properties panel on the right.

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/en/josm_tags.png)
-   You can add, edit, and delete these tags from this panel. The tags
    are traditionally in English however, so it is often better to use
    the Presets menu.

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

-   Sometimes it can be annoying to click over and over to select
    different options and menus in JOSM. Luckily there are shortcut keys
    on the keyboard that allow you to do many common tasks. Here is a
    list of some of the most commonly used shortcut keys, along with
    what they do:
-   s: Choose the Select tool
-   a: Choose the Draw tool
-   z: Choose the Zoom tool
-   + (plus): Zoom In
-   - (minus): Zoom Out
-   p: Split Way
-   c: Combine Way
-   o: Align in Circle
-   l: Align in line
-   q: Orthogonalize (make a shape square)

Summary
-------

As you can see there are many additional features that make JOSM a
powerful tool for making maps. Remember that the more you practice with
these tools, the better you will become at adding information to
OpenStreetMap.

In the final chapter we will step away from JOSM, and look at some
interesting projects that use OpenStreetMap data, and learn how you can
continue learning about OSM.
