Getting started on OpenStreetMap.org
====================================

In this section we will learn step by step how to navigate the
OpenStreetMap website, view maps, and sign up for a user
account. After you have your own username and password, you will be able
to contribute your first points to the map.

![website][]

Visit the OpenStreetMap Website
-------------------------------
-   Before you begin, be sure your computer is connected to the internet.
    (If you are reading this online, then you must be connected!)
-   Open your web browser. Common browsers are Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Internet
    Explorer. If it is already open then you can create a new tab.
-   In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following and press Enter:
    [www.openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)
-   When the page has finished loading, you should see something like
    this:

    ![OpenStreetMap website with some main functions listed][]

Navigate the Map
----------------

-   The main thing you should see is the map. Move the map by clicking
    on it with your left mouse button, holding the button down, and
    dragging your mouse around (see figure below).

    ![Mouse navigation][]

-   If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, zoom in and out on the map
    by turning the wheel. If you don’t have a scroll-wheel, use the +
    and – buttons on in the upper left corner of the map. (see figure
    below)
-   To search for a place, left-click in the box labelled “Search” on
    the left side of the page (see figure above). Type in the name of
    your town or village and press Enter. A window should appear to the
    left of the map with the results of your search. Click on the
    location that looks like the one you want. The map will
    automatically move to the location you chose.
    ![Search][]
   

View Different Map Styles
------------------------
OpenStreetMap contains geographic data from all over the world. Although
it is a single database, the data can be interpreted and styled in
different ways. To see this in action, let's look at various map "styles"
available on the OSM website.

-   Click on the Layers button on the right side of the map window.

    ![Layers button][]

-   Click on the different style options for the map. Notice how the map
    changes with each one. The transport map, for example, emphasizes
    transportation routes on the map while the cycle map emphasizes cycling
    routes. All of the data to make this possible is contained in the OSM
    database.

    ![Transport map][]

Create an OpenStreetMap Account
-------------------------------

-   Now that you have seen what the main website looks like, you can
    register for a username and password and make your first additions
    to the map.
-   On the OpenStreetMap website, click “sign up” in the top
    right corner of the page.
-   You should see a new page that looks like this:

    ![Registering an OpenStreetMap account][]

-   There are five boxes on this page that you need to fill in to
    register an account with OSM.
-   Enter your email address in the first two boxes. You should enter
    the same email address in both boxes. Later, you will need to open
    your email to confirm your account with OpenStreetMap.
-   In the third box, enter the username that you would like to have.
    You will not be able to choose a username that someone else has
    chosen before, so it should be creative. If you try to enter
    something simple, like your first name, it is likely that someone
    has already claimed that name.
-   Enter a new password in the fourth and fifth boxes. You should enter
    the same password in both boxes. It does not need to be the same as
    the password for your email.
-   You may want to write down your OSM username and password. You will
    need to it log in later.
-   After you have completed all the boxes, click "Sign Up" at the
    bottom of the page.
-   If there are any problems, an error message may pop up. Check to
    make sure that your email is the same in the first two boxes, and
    your password is the same in the bottom two boxes. If the third box
    is highlighted red, it means that someone else has already chosen
    your username, and you should try a different name.
-   Open a separate window or tab in your internet browser, and navigate
    to your email.  Common email sites are [mail.yahoo.com](http://mail.yahoo.com)
    and [www.gmail.com](http://www.gmail.com).
-   Enter your email address and your email password to open your email.
    Note that this is __not__ the same as your OpenStreetMap username and
    password.
-   If everything was successful with your registration, you should see
    an email from OpenStreetMap in your inbox. Open the email. It should
    look like the image below. Click on the link that is identified
    below:

    ![Confirming your OpenStreetMap account][]

-   A new tab or window will open. If everything went well, you should
    have an OSM account!
-   On the OpenStreetMap page, click “log in” in the top right corner.
    Enter your OpenStreetMap username and password and press Enter. You
    should now be logged in. You should see your username in the upper
    right corner of the page.

Adding Your First Points
------------------------

-   Now that you are logged in with your username on the OpenStreetMap
    website, you can use the iD editor to add your first point to
    the map.
-   Move the map to a place that you know very well, such as your town
    or village.
-   Zoom in to a place where you would like to add a point to the map.
-   Just above the map on the left, there is a tab named “Edit” with a small
    triangle besides it. Click the small triangle. You should see a menu
    drop down.
-   Click “Edit with iD (in-browser editor)”.

    ![Click edit][]

-   The online editor, named iD, should open. It will look something like this.

    ![iD editor][]

-   You can add a point to the map by clicking on the button named "Point" at
    the top the window. Then click on the map where you would like to add a new
    point.

    ![Point button][]    

-   Select from the menu on the left what type of location it is that you are
    adding to the map. You can then fill in the appropriate form with the location's
    name and other information.
-   To save your changes, click the "Save" button at the top. Since this is your
    first edit, you may prefer to play around with the editor. Don't save your changes
    unless you are sure they are correct.

    ![Save button][]    

-   If you do click Save, you will be asked to provide a description of your changes.
    Then you can click "Save" once more, and your additions will be saved to the
    OSM database!

<!-- link to iD editor chapter when ready -->

The iD editor is a fantastic way to easily edit OpenStreetMap. However, in the next chapter
we will be looking at JOSM, a standalone application that offers many more features. Feel free
to continue playing with iD. Once you have more experience contributing to OSM, you can choose
which editor you like using the best.

Summary
-------

Congratulations! If all went well you now have an OpenStreetMap username
and password, you know how to navigate the OSM website, and you have
your first understanding of how to add points to the map.

In the next chapter, we will install a desktop editor for OpenStreetMap,
called JOSM, and learn better how to draw digital maps.
