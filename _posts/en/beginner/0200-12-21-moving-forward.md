Further Reading
===============

If you have made it this far, congratulations! You should have a good
understanding now of how to make maps with OpenStreetMap. What else can
you do with OSM? How can you learn more? How can you stay connected to
the community of mappers?

Learn More
----------

There is a lot of information about OpenStreetMap available at
[wiki.openstreetmap.org](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). Here you can
find information about other projects that are related to OpenStreetMap,
and documents and tutorials that can help you learn more about OSM.

![Wiki][]

<!-- also more info on this site once it is prepared -->

Mailing List
------------

The best way to get connected to the OpenStreetMap user community is to
join your local mailing list. Many people sign up, using their email
accounts to the OSM mailing list. Once you are on the list, you can send
an email to the group if you have a question or want to talk about
OpenStreetMap.

-   To sign up for your country's mailing list, open your internet
    browser and go to
    [lists.openstreetmap.org](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/).

![Mailing list][]

-   Scroll down the page to find the list associated with your country.
    The country lists are named "Talk-lg", where lg represents the
    country of that list. For example, "Talk-id" is the list for
    Indonesia.
-   Click on the list you want to join.
-   Enter the following information in the boxes on this page:

    -   your email address
    -   your first name
    -   a new password
    -   repeat the password

-   When you are finished, click Subscribe.
-   Now you need to open your email, just as you did when you signed up
    for OpenStreetMap. There will be a confirmation email
    in your inbox from the mailing list.
-   Click on the confirmation link.
-   You should now be a member of the mailing list.
-   Now when you want to send a message to the list, you can send it to
    [talk-id@openstreetmap.org](mailto:talk-id@openstreetmap.org),
    replacing "id" with the country for your list. You will also receive
    emails when other members send a message to the list.

MapOSMatic
----------

One such project is called MapOSMatic, which you can access through your
internet browser at [maposmatic.org](http://www.maposmatic.org/). This
is a simple tool for printing a map of any area you choose. It will
automatically create the map, along with a grid over the map, and an
index of locations that are included in the area.

Summary
-------

These are some of the ways that you can use and stay connected with the
OpenStreetMap community and learn more. We hope you'll continue
exploring and learning more about OSM, and contribute to the project.
Happy Mapping!
