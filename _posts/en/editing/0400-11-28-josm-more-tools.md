More Tools
============
The **buildings_tools** and **utilsplugin2** plugins add great additional
functionality into JOSM. In this section we'll take a closer look
at the functions they provide.

The Buildings Tools Plugin
--------------------------
-   If you haven't already, install this plugin following the instructions
    in [JOSM Plugins](/en/editing/josm-plugins).

![buildings_tools plugin][]

The Buildings Tools plugin is very helpful for digitizing buildings.
It allows you to trace one side of a rectangular building, and easily
extend the shape. If you are digitizing many buildings, this plugin
will save you clicks, and thereby save you time.

Once the plugin has been installed you will see a new button on the left
side of JOSM, which looks like this:

![buildings_tools button][]

-   Start JOSM and create a new empty layer.
-   Select the building tool and click twice to draw a line on the map.

![Draw edge][]

-   Then extend the mouse and click again to draw a rectangle.

![Extend building][]

-   This will not only create a rectangle with only three clicks, but
    it will also automatically apply the building=yes tag to the shape.

### Complex Buildings
You can also create more complicated buildings by first drawing several
overlapping buildings and then merging them together.

-   Draw two buildings which over lap, so that they form an L shape.
-   Select both buildings (hold SHIFT to select more than one object).
-   Go to Tools->Join overlapping Areas or press SHIFT+J on your keyboard.

![Merge buildings][]

### Edit Settings
Furthermore, you can alter the default settings of the plugin.

-   Go to Data->Set buildings size.

![Set buildings size][]

-   If you are creating many similarly sized buildings, you can set specific
    width and height dimensions of the buildings, such as 6 x 10 meters (the unit
    is in meters).

![Set buildings size dialog][]

-   By setting the dimensions you will only need two clicks to create precisely
    sized buildings.

Lastly, you can click on the Advanced button if you would like to add additional
tags that will automatically be applied to every building. For example,
if every building you draw is on the same street, you might add a tag
which identifies the street that will be automatically applied.

Utilsplugin2
-------------
-   If you haven't already, install this plugin following the instructions
    in [JOSM Plugins](/en/editing/josm-plugins).

![utilsplugin2 plugin][]

After you have installed the plugin and restarted JOSM, you will have
a new menu at the top named "More Tools."

![more tools menu][]

Create a new layer and experiment with some of the new tools. Here we
describe some of the most useful new tools:

1.  **Add Nodes at Intersections:**  This tool is very helpful for adding
    missing nodes in intersections of selected ways.  It is good
    practice that roads should always have common nodes where
    they intersect.

    ![nodes interesection][]

2.  **Copy Tags from Previous Selection:**  This function makes copying tags
    easier.  If you want to create many objects with the same tags,
    first draw the objects.  Then add the tags to one object.  Click on
    another object and press Shift + R to copy the tags from the
    previously selected object.  You can do this for all objects that
    you want to tag.  Remember that the tags will be copied from the
    previously selected object, so if you click on an untagged object
    and then another untagged object, you will not be able to copy any
    tags.

    ![copy tags][]

3.  **Add Source Tag:** This tool simplifies adding a source tag.  It
    remembers the source that was specified last and adds it as
    remembered source tag to your objects.   You can insert the source
    with just one click.  

4.  **Replace Geometry:** This tool is great if you want to redraw a poorly
    shaped object, but want to keep the history, attributes and ID
    number of that object.  For example, if you come across a building
    that is complicated and drawn in a poor fashion, then instead of
    painfully changing each node, you can draw the object again,
    select the old and new objects, and select ¨Replace Geometry¨ to
    transfer all the information over.

    ![replace geometry][]


### More Selection Tools
Utilsplugin2 also provides more tools on the "Selection" menu.
Try experimenting with them.

![selection menu][]

One of our favorite selection tools is **Unselect Nodes:** This tool deselects
all nodes. This can be useful if you draw a box to select many objects, but you do not
want to select the nodes contained within all the lines and shapes.

![unselect nodes][]

Good luck!
