The iD Editor is not perfect, and you may encounter situations where it doesn't work correctly (a bug), or have an idea for it to work better. The best way to get your bug or idea taken care of is to submit it to GitHub. GitHub is where the source code for the iD Editor (and many, many other pieces of software) is kept, so submitting your "issue" (GitHub calls both bugs and ideas "issues") there is easiest for the developers.

# Submitting Issues to GitHub

1. Go to the iD Editor issue reporting area in GitHub:
  1. From within iD, click on the "Bug" icon in the lower right, or
  2. Go to [https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues)
2. Sign up with GitHub (if necessary)
3. Log in to GitHub
4. Search to find if your problem has already been reported
  1. Find the search box in the upper right (has magnifying glass in it)
  2. By default, it will have the filters “is:issue” and “is:open” 
  3. Enter likely search terms next to the filters and hit return
  4. Click on the issue titles to read details and comments about the issues
5. If you find your issue has already been reported, you can add a comment to that issue if it would be helpful. You can also click Subscribe (to the right, under Notifications) if you’d like to receive notices when there are updates to the issue.
6. If your issue has not been reported, click the green "New issue" button in the upper right. When that opens, add a meaningful title, and report your bug/suggestion/idea with  enough detail for someone to act upon it. Click Submit New Issue at the bottom when done.
