What is GPS?
------------

A GPS is like a mobile phone, except that instead of receiving radio
signals from telephone companies, it receives signals from satellites
that are going around the Earth. By receiving these signals from the
satellites, a GPS is able to calculate your exact location on the
planet. It records this location in *coordinates*, which are two long
numbers. One number tells you how far East or West you are - this is
called *longitude*. The second number tells you how far North or South
you are - this is called *latitude*. Every place on Earth has unique
geographic coordinates.

For example: -8.639298 Latitude, 116.311607 Longitude is a location in
Lombok, Indonesia.

Turn on the etrex 20
---------------------

-  Before you turn on your GPS, go outside where you have a clear view
    of the sky. Because the GPS determines your location by receiving
    signals from satellites, it won’t work indoors.
-  On the right side of your GPS, press and hold the Power button. The
    GPS will start, and it will show you the Satellites page. You should
    see something like the image below. Your GPS is looking for
    satellite signals. When it has connected to three or more
    satellites, it will have your location.
-  Once your location is determined, the Satellite screen will
    disappear and you will see the main menu.

Navigate the etrex 20
----------------------

- The GPS has different screens and menus that allow you to do
    different things. Use the joystick to scroll down between the
    various menus from the Main Menu screen, they shall look like this:

-  By pressing the joystick, you should be able to enter different
    menus. Let's focus first on “Mark Waypoint” and “Manage Tracks”

-  If you return to the Satellites page using the Back button, you can
    see that you are connected to three or more satellites. In the upper
    left corner are your coordinates, your latitude and longitude.
-  Flip to the Map page, and you can see a map of where you are. If you
    have added OSM maps to your GPS, you may see roads and
    places. Otherwise, the map may look quite
    blank. Zoom in and out by pressing the up and down arrow buttons on
    the left side of the GPS.

>    To add OSM to your GPS, you need a gmapsupp.img
>    file. You can download some, eg from GeoFabrik website:
>    [http://download.geofabrik.de/openstreetmap/](http://download.geofabrik.de/openstreetmap/)

Set up etrex 20
---------------

-  If you are using multiple GPS devices it is important to ensure that
    all the devices are set to the same format. To check this go to the
    “Main Menu” and find “Set up Menu”. Click on “Units” and make sure
    the *Position Format* is set to decimal degrees (hddd.ddddd°),
    the Map Datum to WGS 84 (which is a calculated standard coordinate
    frame, or spheroidal reference surface, for the Earth), and the
    distance speed, elevation and depth are set to meters.
-  GPS + GLONASS

Tracks and Waypoints
--------------------

Your GPS records two kinds of information that are useful for creating
maps or saving the coordinates of a place. First, it allows you to save
your location in the memory of the GPS. When you save a location, the
coordinates will be saved with a name. For example, your first saved
point will be named 001, the second 002, and so
on. When you save a point, you can write down the
number on a piece of paper, along with a note about what it is, any any
attribute or indicators you would like to know. Saved locations on your
GPS are called *waypoints*.

> If your GPS does not start at 001 and you would
> like to clear the previous points, go to the “Find” icon in the main
> menu. Hit “waypoints” and then the submenu button on the right side to
> display the Waypoint submenu. Scroll down to “Delete” click “all
> symbols” and “Yes”.

Second, your GPS can save what are called *tracks*. While a waypoint
only saves a single location, a track will save a series of locations
wherever you move. For example, the track will record your location
every one second, or every one meter, and the result will be a series of
dots that show the path of where you have been. Tracks are useful for
mapping objects that are represented by lines or shapes, such as the
course of a road, or the shape of a field.

Save Your Location in etrex 20
------------------------------

-  To save your current location as a waypoint, using the joystick,
    navigate to the Mark Waypoint menu and and push the joystick button
    down to select “ Done”.

    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/etrex_html_50171a5b_en.png)

    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/etrex_html_5a8bddfa_en.png)

    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/etrex_html_m117d5ee5_en.png)

-  You can see on this page some information about the waypoint that
    you are saving. First is the name. If this is your first waypoint,
    it probably reads “001”. This is the number you should record on
    paper along with the information you want to collect with this
    object. Next you will see the time and date when the point is
    recorded. Below that are the coordinates, followed by the altitude.
-  Use the joystick to move to the “OK” button at the bottom of the
    screen. Press the joystick button down to save this point. Be sure
    to write down the number of the point, along with what the place is
    and any other information you want to record about the place in your
    notebook.
-  Use the joystick to go to the map page. You should now see your
    point on the map.

Turn on the Track Log in etrex 20
---------------------------------

-  Now that we have learned how to save points, let’s learn how to turn
    the track log on and off. When the track log is turned on, it will
    automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the
    log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished.
    You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the
    path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road,
    it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the
    road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and
    any other important information about the road.

-  To turn on the track log, use the joystick to open the “Manage
    Tracks” page.

    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/etrex_html_227e8c80_en.png)

-  If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier
    recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the
    joystick down. The bar at the top should read “0%”.
-  To turn on the log, move the joystick to highlight “On”, and press
    the joystick down. The track log is now recording your path.
-  Under the “Set up” option, you also can set time or distance
    intervals to track. Time intervals instruct your GPS to record your
    location at given intervals. If you have a memory card in your GPS,
    it is good practice to set this to *1**second*, meaning that every
    second your location will be added to the track log. This may be
    useful when detailed surveys are needed.
-  ADD enable write when full
-  ADD set up with SD card
-  Press the “Back” button to go to the map page. As you move you will
    see your track shown as a series of dots.

Copy Waypoints and Tracks to the Computer from etrex 20
-------------------------------------------------------

### Attach GPS to the Computer

-  When you are finished mapping with the GPS you will want to copy the
    points and tracks to your computer so that you can open them in
    JOSM. First, turn off the track log on your GPS, by going to the
    track page and selecting “Off”.
-  Attach the GPS to your computer with the cable. One end should plug
    into your computer’s USB port, and the other goes into the back of
    the GPS, beneath the rubber flap at the top. The GPS should be
    turned on to copy the points and tracks.
-  The GPS Garmin eTrex20 is recognized as a mobile storage unit (USB
    stick) named **Garmin**

### Download GPS data to the Computer

- Navigate to the GPX file Waypoint\_XX-MMMM-YY.gpx in the folder GPX
    to retrieve your waypoints.

    _Path: Garmin eTrex 20 \> Garmin \> GPX_
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/etrex_html_m6ed1f590_en.png)

-  Navigate to the GPX file Current.gpx to retrieve your track.

    _Path: Garmin eTrex 20 \> Garmin \> GPX \> Current_
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/etrex_html_6d5cc501_en.png)

### Install etrex Drivers

-  You may need to install GPS drivers on your computer. If you have a
    copy of USBDrivers\_23.exe on your computer, double-click it and
    install.
-  If you don’t have this file, you can download it. Open your internet
    browser and go to:
    [http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=591](http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=591)
-  Click “Download” to get the installation file. Locate it on your
    computer, and double-click to install.


### Open in JOSM

-   Now open JOSM. On the top menu, click “File” and then click “Open…”
-   Find and select the file that you created with GPSBabel. Click “Open”.
-   You should now see your points and tracks loaded into JOSM.

Summary
-------

Congratulations! You should now have an understanding of how to use the
GPS. If you haven’t already, practice saving points of some important
locations. In this chapter you learned how to open your points and
tracks in JOSM. In Chapter 6, we will use this information to add new
places to OpenStreetMap.
