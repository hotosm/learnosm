Surveying with Walking Papers
=============================

In this chapter we will see how we can record the coordinates of places
without a GPS. We will use a tool called Walking Papers, which allow you
to print a map of an area, draw on it and add notes, and load the paper
back into JOSM, where you can add your locations to OpenStreetMap.

Overview of Walking Papers
--------------------------

Before we walk go into detail about Walking Papers, let's look at an
overview of how the process works:

1. Locate the area you want to map on the Walking Papers
website. Print out a map of this area. You can choose to print the
current map of the area on OpenStreetMap, or you can choose to print
aerial imagery, if it is available in your area.

2. Use your printed map to survey the area. Add more places by
drawing them on the map. Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings, and
so forth. Write notes about each location directly on the map, or write
numbers on the map that relate to numbers in your notebook, where you
can write more detailed information about each object.

3. Scan your paper into the computer. If you don't have a
scanner, you can take a photograph of the paper, if your camera is able
to take high quality pictures. Upload the image to the Walking Papers
website.

4. In JOSM, load the Walking Paper. Use the objects you draw as
a reference to add them digitally into OpenStreetMap.

How does Walking Papers work?
-----------------------------

If you follow the Walking Papers process described above, you will be
collecting accurate geographic coordinates of places with nothing more
than paper. How is this possible?

![paper QR code][]

When you print a Walking Paper, the paper comes with a square barcode on
the bottom of the page. This bar code allows Walking Papers to determine
the exact location of the map that you are using to survey. Later, when
you load the paper back into JOSM, all the objects that you drew will be
in shown in their actual locations, or at least quite close, which is
good enough for us.

Now let's learn how to create and use Walking Papers.

Create and Print
----------------

-   Open your web browser – this may be Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or
    Internet Explorer.
-   In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following
    text and press Enter:
    [walking-papers.org](http://walking-papers.org/)
-   The website should look something like this:

    ![walking paper 1][]

-   Scroll down the page using the wheel on your mouse, or by dragging
    the scroll bar on the right side of the page. Stop when you see the
    map, as shown here:

    ![paper create map][]

-   The map that you see shows the area that you would like to print on
    paper. You can move the map the same way you move the map on the
    OpenStreetMap website, using your left mouse button to drag the map
    East or West, and your scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the map.
    Left-clicking on the + and – buttons in the upper left corner will
    also zoom in and out.
-   Just above the map is a search box with a "Find" button next to it.
    You can use this to search for a location and move the map there
    automatically. Try typing the name of your village or town inside
    the box, and click "Find". If Walking Papers finds the location you
    typed, the map will automatically move there.
-   Just below the map are some additional options. The first option is
    labelled "Orientation." This allows you to change the size and
    orientation of your printed map. Try changing this by clicking in
    the box next to "Orientation" and selecting "Landscape (A4)". You
    should see the size and shape of the map change to be wide, and
    sized to be printed on A4 size paper.
-   Click on the box next to the word "Provider:" Here you can select
    from different options that will change how the map looks. Most of
    the options show different styles of map, such as thinner lines, or
    different colors and text. Click on "Bing Aerial Imagery" and
    instead of a map you will see imagery provided by Microsoft of the
    location you are viewing. Note that not all locations are covered by
    high quality imagery, so what you see may be blurry, and not very
    useful for making maps!
-   Make sure that the map shows the area that you want to map. Even
    after you search for your location, you may want to move the map
    around to choose the right area. When you zoom in and out of the
    map, you are changing what are called "zoom levels", which is simply
    a way of saying how close you are zoomed in. When you are zoomed as
    far away as possible and you can see the whole Earth, you are at
    zoom level 0. When you zoom in as far as you can go you are at zoom
    level 18. The current zoom level is shown just above the map.
    Usually zoom level 15, 16, or 17 is good for making Walking Papers.
-   Let's make the print now! If you have found the area you are
    interested in mapping and have selected the options that make your
    paper look good, you are ready. Click the button labelled "Make",
    just below the map.
-   You will see a new page which says that your print is being
    processed. When it is finished, you will see your print on this
    page. It usually take anywhere from a few minutes up to twenty
    minutes for a print to be completed.

    ![paper prepare print][]

-   When your print is ready, click "Download map PDF for print". The
    Walking Paper should begin downloading.
-   When the download is finish, open the PDF file. Connect your
    computer to a printer and print the page. If everything goes well,
    you should now have your map printed on paper.

Map with Walking Papers
-----------------------

-   Take your Walking Paper outside, and use it as a guide to walk and
    identify new places that are not on the map.
-   Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings, and so forth. Write
    notes about each location directly on the map, or write numbers on
    the map that relate to numbers in your notebook, where you can write
    more detailed information about each object.

    ![paper example][]

-   When you are satisfied with your additions on the paper map, then
    you can add them digitally into OpenStreetMap.

Scan and Upload
---------------

-   Walking Papers are very useful for mapping with nothing more than
    paper, but they are not 100% magic. We will still need to add our
    paper into JOSM, add our information digitally, and save our changes
    on OpenStreetMap.
-   The first step is to scan your Walking Paper into your computer. You
    can do this by attaching a scanner to your computer, scanning the
    paper, and saving it as an image file. If you don't have a scanner,
    you can take a photography of the paper, but you should be carefuly
    to take a very good photo. Make sure that the paper is flat and your
    camera is directly in front of it. Be sure to include the barcode in
    the image, as Walking Papers will not work without it. Here is an
    example of a scanned/photographed image:

    ![paper exmaple 2][]

-   Once you have your walking paper scanned and saved on the computer,
    open your web browser and return to walking-papers.org, just as
    before.
-   Click on the "Upload" tab.

    ![paper upload 1][]

-   Click "Browse..." and navigate to the file where you
    scanned/photographed your Walking Paper.
-   Click "Send."
-   It may take a few minutes for your paper to upload, depending on the
    speed of your internet connection. When the upload finishes, you
    will see a new page with a couple questions about your scan.

    ![paper upload 2][]

-   Next to the question, "Do you plan to edit this yourself?" select
    "No". This will make your paper public, so that other mappers can
    see it too.
-   In the empty box at the bottom, describe what you mapped. This might
    include the location and the types of objects that you added.
-   Click "Save." Your Walking Paper will begin to process. This may
    take 20 minutes or more. If you made your paper public by selecting
    "No" on the previous page, you can close your internet browser and
    return to it later when it has finished processing.

Open in JOSM
------------

-   When your scan has finished processing, you can load it into JOSM
    and use it to add your information to OpenStreetMap. Return to the
    Walking Papers website, by typing
    [walking-papers.org](http://walking-papers.org/) in your web
    browser, just as before.
-   Click "Scans".
-   Find your paper from the list, and click on it. You should see
    something like this:

    ![paper scanned][]

-   To load the paper into JOSM, we need to copy the ID of the Walking
    Paper you have scanned. In the URL bar at the top of your internet
    browser, select the text and press CTRL+C on your keyboard to copy.
    The text should look similar to this:
    [http://walking-papers.org/scan.php?id=fmxcgdqd](http://walking-papers.org/scan.php?id=fmxcgdqd)
-   Now open JOSM. In Chapter 3 we installed the Walking Papers plugin,
    which allows us to see our scan. If you don't have Walking Papers
    installed, go back to Chapter 3.3 for instructions on how to
    install.
-   On the top menu of JOSM, Click "Walking Papers". Then click "Scanned
    Map..."
-   Press CTRL+V on your keyboard to paste the text that you copied from
    the Walking Papers website.
-   Click OK.
-   If all went well, you should see your Walking Paper load into JOSM.
    In the next chapter, we will see how to add the places that you
    mapped into OpenStreetMap.

Repeat!
-------

-   After you add your changes to OSM, they will finally be saved on the
    map. Then the next time you want to improve the map, you can print
    out a new Walking Paper which will include the changes that you
    made. As this process is repeated, the map will get better and
    better, the more you map!

Summary
-------

Congratulations! In this chapter you learned the process of using
Walking Papers and how they work. You learned how to print, map, and
scan a Walking Paper. In the next chapter, we will learn how to add the
places that we mapped into OpenStreetMap, and you will have learned the
complete process of editing the map.
