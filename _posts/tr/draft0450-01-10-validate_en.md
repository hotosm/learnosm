LearnOSM's HOT Tips section is designed to help new mappers start to map for HOT and other aid agencies. We all make mistakes as we learn, and many of us still make mistakes throughout our mapping. As a validator you check the squares within the Tasking Manager that have been mapped, and correct any errors you may find. Sometimes you would like to send some helpful feedback to another mapper, and HOT Tips is designed to help you do that. 

Sending a link to a new mapper who does not know how to create round buildings  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HOT Tips section that shows how to [create a round building using the iD editor is here](/en/hot-tips/tracing-round-buildings/). Your web browser will show the address as;  

      http://learnosm.org/en/hot-tips/tracing-round-buildings/

You can click on this in your web browser, highlight all of it, and then copy this for pasting into a link in the Tasking Manager.  

Of course you may prefer to link to a guide on another site such as the tracing guides available at <http://hotosm.github.io/tracing-guides/> or even a user diary or some other source.

Thanks for your help on this.  
Keep up the good work.  
I look forward to seeing more squares completed by you.  
This is only a small hiccup - keep up the good work, it is appreciated.
