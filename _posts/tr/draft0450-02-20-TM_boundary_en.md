Tasking Manager Boundary Box not loading
============

In the very unlikely event that there is a problem with the boundary box from the Tasking Manager 'square' not loading when iD loads, a possible workround is

1. Load task in iD

2. return to Task on TM, go back to 'edit with' and select JOSM

3. You will get an error message about JOSM remote control, but it will give you access to a section of the JOSM menu

4. From the section that reads "Tip: Download the following .gpx file and load it in JOSM in order to see the current task boundary" right click on ".gpx file" and select "Save link as" - I put mine in my downloads folder.

4. Back to the iD tab in your browser, and have file manager open as well - drag & drop the downloaded .gpx file onto the window of ID -- then wait...

5. If all goes well you now have the square on your iD screen. It may take a long time to load on my setup & a message about waiting or closing may appear - wait.....
