## Mapathons and similar events

  * [Wiki entry about Missing Maps Mapathons](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Missing_Maps_mapathons) nearly a checklist giving you an idea what to consider if you want to organize a mapathon; although targeted towards Missing Maps most of it applies to mapathons in general
  * [Wiki entry about Missing Maps Mapathons in a University setting](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Missing_Maps_mapathons:_for_students_and_universities) nearly the same document as the previous one but with specific hints if organized at a university
  * [developmentSEED guide for Mapathons](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2015/06/07/organizing-mapathons/) This document is based on a talk at a State of the Map conference about how to organize and run a mapathon

### Checklists for planning

  * [MapGive checklist for an event](https://mapgive.state.gov/box/#resources&event-checklist)

### Handouts 

  * [Missing Maps printout materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwOZ7Miy-DQdZFBGYXJ2QWljLWM) most handouts are branded for Missing Maps so if you would like to use them for a different event you should  seek permission to adapt them
