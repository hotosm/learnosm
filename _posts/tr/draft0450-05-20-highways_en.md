If roads or highways are not joined together, you cannot go from one to another. If the task you are working on involves highways, make sure they join where they should. When using the iD editor, you will see a 'dot' of a different colour if one highway joins the other - no dot and the highways do not join.  

Sometimes items should not join - a highway on a bridge over another highway, or a highway on a bridge over a waterway such as a ditch, stream or river.  

If the Tasking Manager project instructions give you no guidance on the tags to apply to a feature, see <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features> for guidance.
