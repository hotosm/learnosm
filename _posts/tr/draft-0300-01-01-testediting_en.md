This is a test document purely to allow Blake to see how this would work for editing purposes
I (Blake) am adding this line to this document because I would like to edit it. I am editing it via the 'edit' pencil in the github interface.
I see I have two options, I can commit it directly and immediately into the master branch or I could create a new branch for these changes to the file and then someone would have to merge that newly created branch into master. I am not sure the best workflow. I think I will go with commit directly into master for this edit.
