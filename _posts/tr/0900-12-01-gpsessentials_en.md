If you don't have access to Google Play or if you want to download versions other than the stable release such as older versions or the latest beta, you can download GPS Essentials from <http://www.images.com>.

Configure GPS Essentials to Work Offline

    ![Map Cache][]

2.  Find a strong network connection. From main screen, select 'Portable Maps'. Every map you view in portable map mode automatically saves to the Android's memory. Save maps you will need offline in as much detail as possible, and slowly zoom in on each waypoint.

3.  Disconnect from the network and view maps in portable map mode. If some maps lack detail, re-connect to a network and slowly zoom in on the map location you need.

GPS feature on Android phone
-------------

Before using the GPS Essentials Application, make sure the GPS in your Android phone is enabled.

Acquiring Satellites
-------------

Before a GPS receiver emits a location (also called a GPS fix), it must receive signals from at least four satellites. The lower the satellite is above the horizon, the longer its signals travel through the atmosphere so satellites high above the horizon usually have better signals.

To check the satellites in your area:

1.  From the main menu, select Satellites.

    ![Satellites page][]

2.  If there are at least four satellites used in the fix, then you may start using the GPS Essentials features.

Creating Tracks
-------------

1.  From the main menu, select Tracks.

2.  Tap on Start from the toolbar. It will create a new track and start recording. Wait some seconds until GPS fix is available.
