Starting with a Tasking Manager - iD editor
============

This guide is written for the [HOT Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/), but the principles are the same for all versions.  

The Essentials
--------------

![TM Start][]


1. Go to a Tasking Manager (TM) site, for example <http://tasks.hotosm.org/>. Using your <http://www.openstreetmap.org> login, authorise the Tasking Manager to access your OpenStreetMap account.  
2.  Start on a project designed for new mappers - these are often 'buildings only' projects.  
3.  Read the **Description** and **Instructions** and make sure you understand what is needed before you start. 
4.  The mapping is checked by 'validators' who often send messages giving valuable feedback on your contributions.  
5.  Start mapping - you may need to read more of the sections in this HOT Tips chapter to get you going. HOT Tips sections on [round buildings](/en/hot-tips/tracing-round-buildings/) or [Buildings with square corners](/en/hot-tips/tracing-rectangular-buildings/) may help.  
6.  Save regularly - see [HOT tips - saving](/en/hot-tips/saving/)  
7.  Be patient - sometimes there is a shortage of validators and lots of new mappers all wanting feedback! Carry on mapping, but when you realise you have made a mistake (we all do!) see if you can fix it, or ask for help.
