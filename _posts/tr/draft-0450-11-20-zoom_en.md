<!--Hi, if you've found your way to this page by following a link sent to you, welcome, please read, and please continue to map. We need your help, and you've been sent the link as your contibution is valued. Hopefully something on this short page, or others like it in this section, will help you to help us more.

When you first load your area to map from the Tasking Manager, you will see;  

1.  A satellite image of your area, with the area for you to work on bordered with a pink line, and  
![Scale][]
2.  A scale line. The line on the screenshot represents 450 metres (The choice of imperial or metric is not made within iD, but elsewhere on your computer)

Before you can start to map with any accuracy you need to zoom in - a scale of roughly 20 metres is normally fine. 
![Scale 3][]


In the screenshot above you can see I have a scale of 20 metres (about 50 feet) and the rectangular buildings are easy to see. When tracing them I will be trying to draw an area exactly where the base of the building meets the ground - the **"buildings footprint"**. You can also see the shadows cast by the buildings. The larger building which is slightly darker in colour has a roof with a central ridge and this can make the building look as if it is a strange shape - actually it's footprint is rectangular. You will soon learn to recognise these shapes, and will welcome shadows as they tell you so much about the building you are tracing.-->
