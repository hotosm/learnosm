Step 1. The basic elements of mapping
-------------------------------------  

**Point** 
A point shows the location of a place, for instance a hospital, restaurant, or water well.

**Node**
A node is part of a line or an area. They create bends when drawing a line or area.  

**Line**  
A line is used to trace a road. Nodes make bends in a line. **Important**: Always place a node where two lines cross so the software can find a path to a location. It will show up as gray.  

**Area**  
An area is a polygon made up of nodes. It defines a building, the outside edges of a village, a wood, or other area. **Important**: Do not connect lines or areas. If they are connected, a node whill show up as gray.
