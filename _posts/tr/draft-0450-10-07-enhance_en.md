Enhancing the colours or background - iD editor
============

- TOC
{:toc}

Introduction
------------

This module covers the changing of the brightness of the satellite imagery which may make it simpler to pick out details, but also covers installation of the Stylish extension on the Firefox and Chrome web browsers, which allows the installation of different colour schemes.  

Changing the colours of traced buildings may make it easier when working in an area with red roofed buildings, or another red backround.  

Other extensions are also available.
